http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brainwave_entrainment	Brainwave entrainment	"Brainwave entrainment or ""brainwave synchronization,"" is any practice that aims to cause brainwave frequencies to fall into step with a periodic stimulus having a frequency corresponding to the intended brain-state (for example, to induce sleep), usually attempted with the use of specialized software. It purportedly depends upon a ""frequency following"" response on the assumption that the human brain has a tendency to change its dominant EEG frequency towards the frequency of a dominant external stimulus. Such a stimulus is often aural, as in the case of binaural or monaural beats and isochronic tones, or else visual, as with a dreamachine, a combination of the two with a mind machine, or even electromagnetic radiation."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neurofeedback	Neurofeedback	Neurofeedback (NFB), also called neurotherapy, neurobiofeedback or EEG biofeedback is a type of biofeedback that uses realtime displays of electroencephalography or functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to illustrate brain activity, often with a goal of controlling central nervous system activity. Sensors are placed on the scalp to measure activity, with measurements displayed using video displays or sound.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predictive_value_of_tests	Predictive value of tests	"Predictive value of tests is the probability of a target condition (for example a disease) given by the result of a test, often in regard to medical tests. In cases where binary classification can be applied to the test results, such yes versus no, test target (such as a substance, symptom or sign) being present versus absent, or either a positive or negative test), then each of the two outcomes has a separate predictive value. For example, for positive or negative test, the predictive values are termed positive predictive value or negative predictive value, respectively. In cases where the test result is of a continuous value, the predictive value generally changes continuously along with the value. For example, for a pregnancy test that displays the urine concentration of hCG, the predictive value increases with increasing hCG value. A conversion of continuous values into binary values can be performed, such as designating a pregnancy test as ""positive"" above a certain cutoff value, but this confers a loss of information and generally results in less accurate predictive values."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnetoencephalography	Magnetoencephalography	Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a technique for mapping brain activity by recording magnetic fields produced by electrical currents occurring naturally in the brain, using very sensitive magnetometers. Arrays of SQUIDs (superconducting quantum interference devices) are currently the most common magnetometer, and SERF being investigated for future machines. Applications of MEG include basic research into perceptual and cognitive brain processes, localizing regions affected by pathology before surgical removal, determining the function of various parts of the brain, and neurofeedback.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endoluminal_capsule_monitoring	Endoluminal capsule monitoring	Endoluminal capsule monitoring is a non-invasive medical diagnostic procedure which uses a miniaturized wireless radio transmitter embedded into an ingestible water-tight capsule. The patient ingests the capsule and while it transits through the gastrointestinal system, it sends signals to the outside, which are captured by a radio receiver, processed, displayed and stored in a computer. According to the type or type(s) of biomedical sensors which are built into the capsule, several physiological parameters can be measured and transmitted by the capsule: intraluminal pH in the esophagus, stomach and duodenum intestinal motility intraluminal pressure Other Modern capsules, called video pills or endoscopic capsules can also transmit endoscopic images from a miniature video camera. The system is normally used for research purposes or for diagnosing long term changes in gastrointestinal physiological parameters. The capsule is recovered in the feces, sterilized and can be used again.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Structured_light_plethysmography	Structured light plethysmography	Structured Light Plethysmography (SLP) technology utilises pc gaming/movie techniques to scan a patient with visible light, capture an image, measure movement in the image and produce accurate, real time data on changes in respiration. A checker board pattern of light is projected from a light projector onto the chest of an individual. Movements of the grid are viewed by two digital cameras, digitalised, and processed to form a 3D model and can be interrogated to assess lung function. The system has been tested on over 70 adults (data presented at clinical meetings). SLP is simple to use, accurate and cost effective, is self-calibrating and does not require the use of plastic consumables, reducing cost, risk of cross infection and the devices carbon footprint. In conjunction with the Cambridge Veterinary School, proof of concept studies have indicated that the device is sensitive enough to non invasively pick up respiratory movements in domestic animals. A totally â€œnon-invasiveâ€ﾝ technique using structured light to measure pulmonary function was developed as long ago as the mid-1980s by a London group at the Royal Brompton Hospital working in close association with IBM (1-4). The technique utilised the distortion with movement of a structured pattern of light to calculate a volume or change in volume of a textured surface. At that time structured light pattern was shone on to the anterior chest and abdominal wall surfaces, and movie camera film footage was taken and sent to IBM for processing. The digital information was used to compute automatically the volume of the trunk and the position of any point on its surface and its cross-sectional shape at any level. The group found that linear dimensions could be calculated to within 0.5mm and a cross-sectional area within 5% and volume within 3-7%. The group suggested that non-invasive technique measurements were of sufficient accuracy to be tried in clinical practice. However, probably due to technology limitations, data processing and storage the methodology was never commercialised. Independently the Royal Brompton group of the 1980s, a Cambridge (UK) consortium of clinicians and engineers developed a system in 2009 that has revisited structure light pattern as a non invasive method for collecting accurate representations of chest and abdominal wall movement. The methodology has several advantages: there are no fluorescent markers required to define chest or abdominal surface and the hardware can be minimalized to 2 digital cameras and a digital projector when imaging the anterior surface of the body. The projector shines a grid of black and white squares from superior iliac crest to clavicle; the subject can wear a plain t-shirt of any colour. The 2 digital cameras image the grid on chest and abdomen and the software extracts 2 sets of 2D image positions of the grid points and stereo vision is used to reconstruct these grid points to form a 3D representation of the chest and abdominal wall surface. The group has tried anything from one grid point to 2000 and is current working on roughly 200 to 300. The thoracic volume is calculated from the volume beneath the reconstructed virtual surface and can be plotted in real time. Calibration is internal: the relative position of cameras and shape of the subject is auto-calibrated at reconstruction time; and externally by placing an object of reference size in front of the cameras. This can be a sheet of paper of known size and potentially has now been transferred to projected points within the grid itself. The group have now collected data on up to 70 adults and 5 children and have also collected data from small mammals. They have compared simultaneous measurements of tidal breathing followed by full inspiration and force expiration by Pneumatac and SLP. The Pneumatac data was obtained using a laptop based spirometer and exported for analysis using J-scope software. Extremely good correlations have been obtained from tidal breaching and forced expiration manoeuvres. Tidal breathing correlations have shown to be 0.99 for individual data sets and for n=70 the mean correlation was 0.92 at an SD of 0.04. For forced expiration the correlation was shown to be 0.98, n=70 mean correlation was 0.98 with an SD of 0.12. For forced expirations inspiratory manoeuvres correlation coefficients for peak flow were rÂ² 0.84, FEV1 0.95, FEF75 0.76 and FEF50 0.69.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/BASFI	BASFI	"The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Functional Index was named for the location of the institution where authors G. Calin and co-workers developed this validated index to determine the degree of functional limitation in patients with the inflammatory autoimmune disease Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS). These researchers recognized that although treatment for AS is focused on pain control and the improvement of function, the available methods of assessing function were not specific to AS and were inadequately validated. In their seminal 1994 publication, Calin and his associates stated that ""after pain and stiffness (measured by the BASDAI test), one of the most important complaints of patients with AS is disability. ""(Calin et al. , 1994, p 2281). The ten questions that comprise the BASFI were chosen with input from patients with AS. The first 8 questions evaluate activities related to functional anatomical limitations due to the course of this inflammatory disease. The final 2 questions evaluate the patientsâ€™ ability to cope with everyday life."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tissue_typing	Tissue typing	"Tissue typing is a procedure in which the tissues of a prospective donor and recipient are tested for compatibility prior to transplantation. An embryo can be tissue typed to ensure that the embryo implanted can be a cord-blood stem cell donor for a sick sibling. One technique of tissue typing, ""mixed leukocyte reaction"", is performed by culturing lymphocytes from the donor together with those from the recipient. Another technique, known as a micro-cytotoxicity assay, utilizes serum with known anti-HLA antibodies that recognize particular HLA loci (HLA-A, HLA-B, HLA-C, HLA-DP, HLA-DQ, HLA-DR) in order to match genetically similar individuals in hopes of performing a tissue transplantation. In this technique a donor's blood cells are MHC typed by mixing them with serum containing the anti-HLA antibodies. If the antibodies recognize their epitope on the MHC then complement activation occurs and the cell will be osmotically lysed. Lysis results in the cell taking up a dye. This allows identification of cell's MHC indirectly based on the specificity of the known antibodies in the serum."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Swedish_interactive_thresholding_algorithm	Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm	Usually referred to as SITA, the 'Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm is a method to test for visual field loss, usually in glaucoma testing or monitoring. It is combined with a visual field test such as standard automated perimetry (SAP) or short wavelength automated perimetry (SWAP) to determine visual fields in a more efficient manner. Standard automated perimetry determines how dim of light (the threshold) can be seen at various points in an individual eye's visual field. Various algorithms have been developed to determine this threshold in the dozens to over a hundred individual points in a single visual field. The SITA algorithm optimizes the determination of perimetry thresholds by continuously estimating what the expected threshold is based on the patient's age and neighboring thresholds. In this manner, it can reduce the time necessary to acquire a visual field by up to 50%. In this manner, it decreases patient fatigue and increases reliability. SITA mode is now widely used in many computerized automated perimeters. The testing mode interrupts testing when measurement error is reached. This results in a shorter test time with reportedly equal accuracy as other automated threshold visual fields. See Visual Field Test

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardiotocography	Cardiotocography	In medicine, cardiotocography (CTG) is a technical means of recording (-graphy) the fetal heartbeat (cardio-) and the uterine contractions (-toco-) during pregnancy, typically in the third trimester. The machine used to perform the monitoring is called a cardiotocograph, more commonly known as an electronic fetal monitor (EFM). The invasive fetal monitoring was invented by Doctors Alan Bradfield, Orvan Hess and Edward Hon. A refined (antepartal, non-invasive, beat-to-beat) version (cardiotocograph) was later developed for Hewlett Packard by Dr. Konrad Hammacher.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulse_oximetry	Pulse oximetry	Pulse oximetry is a non-invasive method allowing the monitoring of the saturation of a patient's hemoglobin. A sensor is placed on a thin part of the patient's body, usually a fingertip or earlobe, or in the case of an infant, across a foot. Light of two wavelengths is passed through the patient to a photodetector. The changing absorbance at each of the wavelengths is measured, allowing determination of the absorbances due to the pulsing arterial blood alone, excluding venous blood, skin, bone, muscle, fat, and (in most cases) nail polish. With NIRS it is possible to measure both oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin on a peripheral scale (possible on both brain and muscle). Reflectance pulse oximetry may be used as an alternative to transmissive pulse oximetery described above. This method does not require a thin section of the patient's body and is therefore well suited to more universal application such as the feet, forehead and chest, but it also has some limitations. Vasodilation and pooling of venous blood in the head due to compromised venous return to the heart, as occurs with congenital cyanotic heart disease patients, or in patients in the Trendelenburg position, can cause a combination of arterial and venous pulsations in the forehead region and lead to spurious SpO2Â  results.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liebermann%E2%80%93Burchard_test	Liebermannâ€“Burchard test	The Liebermannâ€“Burchard or acetic anhydride test is used for the detection of cholesterol. The formation of a green or green-blue colour after a few minutes is positive. Liebermanâ€“Burchard is a reagent used in a colourimetric test to detect cholesterol, which gives a deep green colour. This colour begins as a purplish, pink colour and progresses through to a light green then very dark green colour. The colour is due to the hydroxyl group (-OH) of cholesterol reacting with the reagents and increasing the conjugation of the un-saturation in the adjacent fused ring. Since this test uses acetic anhydride and sulfuric acid as reagents, caution must be exercised so as not to receive severe burns. MethodÂ : Dissolve one or two crystals of cholesterol in dry chloroform in a dry test tube. Add several drops of acetic anhydride and then 2 drops of conc.H2SO4 and mix carefully. After the reaction finished, the concentration of cholesterol can be measured using spectrophotometry.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronchial_challenge_test	Bronchial challenge test	A bronchial challenge test is a medical test used to assist in the diagnosis of asthma. The patient breathes in nebulized methacholine or histamine. Thus the test may also be called a methacholine challenge test or histamine challenge test respectively. Both drugs provoke bronchoconstriction, or narrowing of the airways. Whereas histamine causes nasal and bronchial mucus secretion and bronchoconstriction via the H1 receptor, methacholine utilizes the M3 receptor for bronchoconstriction. The degree of narrowing can then be quantified by spirometry. People with pre-existing airway hyperreactivity, such as asthmatics, will react to lower doses of drug. Sometimes, to assess the reversibility of a particular condition, a bronchodilator is administered to counteract the effects of the bronchoconstrictor before repeating the spirometry tests. This is commonly referred to as a reversibility test, or a post bronchodilator test (post BD), and may help in distinguishing asthma from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. False positives and negatives are possible in the bronchial challenge test. In addition, asthma may be temporary due to an exposure to noxious stimuli or exercise. The bronchial challenge test is physically demanding, and the results can be affected by muscular weakness or exhaustion. The inhaled drug can stimulate the upper airway sufficiently to cause violent coughing. This can make spirometry difficult or impossible. This test is contraindicated in patients with severe airway obstruction due to the obvious worsening of the obstruction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Focused_Impedance_Measurement	Focused Impedance Measurement	The Focused Impedance Measurement (FIM) is a recent technique for measurement of tissue impedance in the human body with improved zone localization compared to conventional methods. This method was proposed and developed by Department of Biomedical Physics and Technology of University of Dhaka under the close supervision of Prof. Khondkar Siddique-e-Rabbani; who first introduced the idea and FIM is considered widely as the brainchild of his. For the simplicity and accuracy offered by FIM, it may prove to be a potential replacement of other earlier methods like Four Electrode Impedance Measurement (FEIM) and Electrical impedance Tomography (EIT) in many practical measurement situations. FIM can be considered as the technique that bridges FEIM and EIT. Many biological parameter and processes can sensed and monitored using their impedance as marker . Measurement of electrical bioimpedance is relatively easy to do. It requires little equipment, can be done with simple and small instruments. Due to the simplicity of the equipment and with the advantage that measurement technique is non-invasive it may be made low cost. Measurement of electrical impedance to obtain physiological or diagnostic information has been of interest to researchers for many years. Conventional Four Electrode or Tetra-polar Impedance Measurement (TPIM) is a simple technique, where current is driven through a pair of electrodes while potential is measured across another pair in order to eliminate the inclusion of contact impedance, but the zone of sensitivity is not well defined and many include organs other that those of interest, thus making the interpretations difficult and unreliable. It needs to be mentioned that for such impedance measurement on the human body, ac driving currents of frequencies greater than 10 kHz are usually employed because of various consideration; tissue electrolysis and unstable contact potential at dc at very low frequencies, and neuro-muscular stimulation at frequencies less than 10 kHz being the main effects that need to be avoided. At the relatively high measurement frequencies, skin electrode impedance are low (because of capacitive reactance) and this allows measurement of tissue impedance in the bulk of the body, even if measurements are made using skin surface electrodes. A remarkable progress in impedance measurements was the introduction of Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) by a group in Sheffield, UK, using which a 2D distribution of tissue impedance in the plane of the electrodes was obtained through back-projection technique similar to that used in X-ray and CT. This used 16 electrodes around the thorax in the transverse plane for its initial applications. The human body has uneven geometry and unequal distribution of conductivity inside, which again varies from person to person and between phases of normal body activity making an accurate analytical treatment difficult. Electrical impedance in tissues is a function of variables such as ion concentrations, cell geometry, extra-cellular fluids, intra-cellular fluids and organ geometry, so it is easy to imagine that sensitivity to different changes in these variables may be detectable. Unfortunately it is difficult to established a link between measured impedance change and a change in one or more of the input variables. This tagged electrical bioimpedance measurements as in general- has good sensitivity but poor specificity. Conventional four-electrode impedance measurements (FEIM) cannot localize a zone of interest in a volume conductor. On the other hand, electrical impedance tomography (EIT) system offers an image with reasonable resolution, but is complex and needs many electrodes. By placing two FEIM systems perpendicular to each other over a common zone at the center and combining the two results, it is possible to obtain enhanced sensitivity over this central zone. This is the basis of the focused impedance measurement (FIM). This new method may be useful for impedance measurements of large organs like stomach, heart, and lungs. Being much simpler in comparison to EIT, multifrequency systems can be simply built for FIM. Besides, FIM may have utility in other fields like geology where impedance measurements are performed.

Phi is one of several brain rhythms in the awake human brain that coordinate human behavior. ""Phi"" operates in the 10-Hz band (ten oscillations per second), and is located above the right centro-parietal cortex. It consists of two components, one favoring independent behaviors, and the other favoring interpersonal coordination between people. The brain wave patterns of the phi complex are consistent with those of waves produced in the human mirror neuron system. The phi complex may reflect the influence of one person upon another's behavior, with phi-1 expressing the inhibition of the human mirror neuron system and phi-2 its enhancement."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cardiac_stress_test	Cardiac stress test	Cardiac stress test (or Cardiac diagnostic test) is a test used in medicine and cardiology to measure the heart's ability to respond to external stress in a controlled clinical environment. The stress response is induced by exercise or drug stimulation. Cardiac stress tests compare the coronary circulation while the patient is at rest with the same patient's circulation observed during maximum physical exertion, showing any abnormal blood flow to the heart's muscle tissue. The results can be interpreted as a reflection on the general physical condition of the test patient. This test can be used to diagnose ischemic heart disease, and for patient prognosis after a heart attack.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scanning_laser_polarimetry	Scanning laser polarimetry	"Scanning laser polarimetry is the use of polarised light to measure the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer as part of a glaucoma workup. The GDx-VCC is one example. However a Dutch study found that while there is a correlation between standard automated perimetry and GDx VCC measurements in patients with glaucoma, suggesting that GDx VCC measurements relate well with functional loss in glaucoma, in healthy subjects, they found virtually no correlation between perimetry and GDx VCC measurements. This would cast doubt on its predictive value and suggests false positives. seeÂ : ""The Relationship between Standard Automated Perimetry and GDx VCC Measurements"", Nicolaas J. Reus and Hans G. Lemij.... From the Glaucoma Service, The Rotterdam Eye Hospital, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. For overview, this first prototype of this instrument was developed about 10 years ago, and was first released commercially as the GDx Nerve fiber analyzer (Laser Diagnostic Technologies Inc). The second generation product is called the GDx Access. The field of view is 15 degree and imaging should be performed through an undilated pupil. The polarised laser scans the fundus, building a monochromatic image. The state of polarisation of the light is changed (retardation) as it passes through birefringent tissue (cornea and RNFL). Corneal birefringence is eliminated (in part) by a proprietary 'corneal compensator'. The amount of retardation of light reflected from the fundus is converted to RFNL thickness. Sub-optimal compensation of corneal birefringence is currently being addressed by the manufacturer with hardware and software modifications. The GDx scanning laser measures the thickness of the retinal nerve fiber layer, which is the very first part of your eye that is damaged by glaucoma. Before we go any further, let we see the basic instrument in this GDx. This instrument use GaAIAs diode laser as a source of light. This diode will emit polarized light. The source is HeNe (632.8Â nm) and argon (514Â nm). Polarization modulator in this instrument will changes the polarization states of the laser output. The linearly polarized beam from the laser is passed through the rotating quarter-wave of retarder. Scanning unit in this instrument is used to moves the beam horizontally and vertically on the retina. The focused of the beam is 35Î¼m in diameter. This instrument also have polarization detector. It uses to detect polarized light that is reflected back from cornea. It also uses to analyze the any change in the polarization of the reflected radiation. This element consists of a second synchronously rotating quarter-wave retarder and a linear polarizer in front of the photo-detector. The output is then sampled, digitized, and stored by a computer."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Photoplethysmogram	Photoplethysmogram	A photoplethysmogram (PPG) is an optically obtained plethysmogram, a volumetric measurement of an organ. A PPG is often obtained by using a pulse oximeter which illuminates the skin and measures changes in light absorption (Shelley and Shelley, 2001). A conventional pulse oximeter monitors the perfusion of blood to the dermis and subcutaneous tissue of the skin. With each cardiac cycle the heart pumps blood to the periphery. Even though this pressure pulse is somewhat damped by the time it reaches the skin, it is enough to distend the arteries and arterioles in the subcutaneous tissue. If the pulse oximeter is attached without compressing the skin, a pressure pulse can also be seen from the venous plexus, as a small secondary peak. The change in volume caused by the pressure pulse is detected by illuminating the skin with the light from a light-emitting diode (LED) and then measuring the amount of light either transmitted or reflected to a photodiode. Each cardiac cycle appears as a peak, as seen in the figure. Because blood flow to the skin can be modulated by multiple other physiological systems, the PPG can also be used to monitor breathing, hypovolemia, and other circulatory conditions (Reisner, et al. , 2008). Additionally, the shape of the PPG waveform differs from subject to subject, and varies with the location and manner in which the pulse oximeter is attached.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miller_Fisher_test	Miller Fisher test	"The Miller Fisher test is a diagnostic procedure used to confirm suspected normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH). The Miller Fisher test confirms NPH if the removal of 30 mL of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) results in clinical improvement of NPH symptoms. Diagnosis of NPH is usually first led by a lumbar puncture, followed by the evaluation of clinical response to removal of CSF. This can be followed by a CT, MRI, and continuous external lumbar CSF drainage during 3 or 4 days. Lumbar puncture is usually the first step in diagnosis of NPH and the opening pressure measured carefully. In most cases, CSF pressure is usually above 155 mmH2O. Clinical improvement after removal of CSF (30 mL or more) has a high predictive value for subsequent success with shunting. This is called the ""lumbar tap test"" or ""Miller Fisher test"". A ""negative"" test has a very low predictive accuracy, as many patients may improve after a shunt in spite of lack of improvement after CSF removal."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phonomyography	Phonomyography	Phonomyography (PMG) (also known as acoustic myography, sound myography, vibromyography, and surface mechanomyogram) is a technique to measure the force of muscle contraction by recording the low frequency sounds created during muscular activity. Although less precise than the more traditional mechanomyography, it is considerably easier to set up. The signal is measured using condenser microphone elements, piezoelectric sensors, accelerometers, or a combination of sensors attached to the skin. Hydrophones have also been used to measure muscles immersed in water. The sound created by muscle movement can be heard with the ear pressed up to a contracting muscle, but most of the energy is low frequency, below 20Â Hz, making it inaudible infrasound. Electromyography signals are typically bandpass filtered from 10 Hz to 500Â Hz, by comparison. PMG signals are limited to 5Â Hz to 100Â Hz in some experiments. Orizio states that the low-frequency response of the sensor is the most important feature, and should go as low as 1Â Hz. Muscle sounds were first described in print by the Jesuit scientist Francesco Maria Grimaldi in a posthumous publication of 1665, which influenced the work of the English physician William Hyde Wollaston and the German scientist Paul Erman. The latter enlisted the aid of RenÃ© Laennec. Mechanical amplification was first employed by Hermann von Helmholtz. The past two centuries of repeated rediscovery and neglect of the phenomenon were summarised by Stokes and Blythe in 2001.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Throat_culture	Throat culture	A throat culture is a laboratory diagnostic test to find a bacterial or fungal infection in the throat. Sampling is performed by throat swab, and the sample is put in a special cup (culture) that allows infections to grow. If an infection grows, the culture is positive. The type of infection is found using a microscope, chemical tests, or both. If no infection grows, the culture is negative. Examples of infections that may be found during a throat culture include: Candida albicans This fungus causes thrush, an infection of the mouth and tongue and sometimes of the throat. See a picture of thrush in the mouth. Template:Where? Group A streptococcus This bacteria can cause strep throat, scarlet fever, and rheumatic fever. If strep throat is likely, a test called a rapid strep test (or quick strep) may be done before a throat culture. With a rapid strep test, results are ready in 10 minutes instead of 1 to 2 days with a throat culture. If the rapid strep test results are positive, antibiotics can be started immediately. A throat culture is more accurate than the rapid strep test. The rapid strep test can give false-negative results even when strep bacteria are present. When the results of a rapid strep test are negative, many health professionals recommend doing a throat culture to make sure that strep throat is not present. Neisseria meningitidis This bacteria can cause meningitis. If bacteria grows in the culture, other tests may be done to check which antibiotic will treat the infection best. This is called susceptibility or sensitivity testing.

The DecisionDx-UM test was clinically validated on these tumors of the uveal tract. DecisionDx-UM assesses the gene expression profile (GEP) of a subset of genes which are differentially expressed in primary tumor cells compared to cells that have undergone transformation to a metastatic phenotype. The test classifies tumors as Class 1A (low metastatic risk), Class 1B (long-term metastatic risk), or Class 2 (immediate, high metastatic risk). Also referred to as the gene expression profile, the test has been directly compared to all other clinical and pathologic factors, such as chromosome 3 status (monosomy 3), cytopathology and tumor size and the DecisionDx-UM test was shown to be more accurate than these other factors. The DecisionDx-UM test has become standard of care in the majority of ocular oncology centers in the U.S. and is recommended by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC). The AJCC recommends this testing for all patients with a diagnosis of uveal melanoma as the results are â€˜clinically significantâ€™. Accurate results are achieved using both fine needle aspirate biopsies (FNAB) or formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue. The prognostic information provided by DecisionDx-UM helps physicians and their patients make individualized decisions about the surveillance and therapeutic options that are most appropriate. The DecisionDx-UM test was exclusively licensed from Washington University in St. Louis and is only available through Castle Biosciences, Incorporated.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_venous_pressure	Central venous pressure	Central venous pressure (CVP) describes the pressure of blood in the thoracic vena cava, near the right atrium of the heart. CVP reflects the amount of blood returning to the heart and the ability of the heart to pump the blood into the arterial system. It is a good approximation of right atrial pressure, which is a major determinant of right ventricular end diastolic volume. CVP has been, and often still is, used as a surrogate for preload, and changes in CVP in response to infusions of intravenous fluid have been used to predict volume-responsiveness (i.e. whether more fluid will improve cardiac output). However, there is increasing evidence that CVP, whether as an absolute value or in terms of changes in response to fluid, does not correlate with ventricular volume or volume-responsiveness, and so should not be used to guide intravenous fluid therapy. Nevertheless, CVP monitoring is a useful tool to guide hemodynamic therapy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saliva_hormone_testing	Saliva hormone testing	Saliva hormone testing is an effort to determine the amount of hormones found in saliva. Though promoted as an accurate way of determining hormone levels in the body, it does not represent either the amount of hormones in the blood, or their biological activity. Saliva testing is often used as part of bioidentical hormone replacement therapy, though it has been criticized for being expensive, unnecessary and meaningless.

It is a specialized flow cytometer that uses high-sensitivity fluorescence detection to give a direct measurement of the concentration of virus particles in a fraction of the time required for traditional plaque assays.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elimination_diet	Elimination diet	"An elimination diet is a method of identifying foods that an individual cannot consume without adverse effects. Adverse effects may be due to food allergy, food intolerance, other physiological mechanisms (such as metabolic or toxins), or a combination of these. Elimination diets typically involve entirely removing a suspected food from the diet for a period of time from two weeks to two months, and waiting to determine whether symptoms resolve during that time period. In rare cases, a health professional may wish to use an oligoantigenic diet to relieve a patient of symptoms they are experiencing. Common reasons for undertaking an elimination diet include suspected food allergies and suspected food intolerances. An elimination diet might remove one or more common foods, such as eggs or milk, or it might remove one or more minor or non-nutritive substances, such as artificial food colorings. An elimination diet relies on trial and error to identify specific allergies and intolerances. Typically, if symptoms resolve after the removal of a food from the diet, then the food is reintroduced to see whether the symptoms reappear. This challenge-dechallenge-rechallenge approach is particularly useful in cases with intermittent or vague symptoms. The terms exclusion diet and elimination diet are often used interchangeably in the literature, and there is no standardised terminology. The exclusion diet can be a diagnostic tool or method used temporarily to determine whether a patientâ€™s symptoms are food-related. The term elimination diet is also used to describe a ""treatment diet"", which eliminates certain foods for a patient. Adverse reactions to food can be due to several mechanisms. Correct identification of the type of reaction in an individual is important, as different approaches to management may be required. The area of food allergies and intolerances has been controversial and is currently a topic that is heavily researched. It has been characterised in the past by lack of universal acceptance of definitions, diagnosis and treatment."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Transcranial_Doppler	Transcranial Doppler	The Transcranial Doppler (TCD) and the more recent Transcranial Color Doppler (TCCD) are test that measures the velocity of blood flow through the brain's blood vessels. Used to help in the diagnosis of emboli, stenosis, vasospasm from a subarachnoid hemorrhage (bleeding from a ruptured aneurysm), and other problems, this relatively quick and inexpensive test is growing in popularity in the United States. The equipment used for these tests is becoming increasingly portable, making it possible for a clinician to travel to a hospital, doctor's office or nursing home for both inpatient and outpatient studies. It is often used in conjunction with other tests such as MRI, MRA, carotid duplex ultrasound and CT scans.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flow_cytometry	Flow cytometry	Flow cytometry is a laser based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them by an electronic detection apparatus. It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second. Flow cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research, clinical practice and clinical trials. A common variation is to physically sort particles based on their properties, so as to purify populations of interest.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ham_test	Ham test	The Ham test is a test used in the diagnosis of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH). The test involves placing red blood cells in mild acid; a positive result (increased RBC fragility) indicates PNH or Congenital dyserythropoietic anemia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Comprehensive_Aphasia_Test	Comprehensive Aphasia Test	The Comprehensive Aphasia Test (CAT) was created by Kate Swinburn, Gillian Porter and David Howard. The CAT is a new test for people who have acquired aphasia, the impairment of language ability. The comprehensive assessment can be completed over one or two sessions. The test contains a cognitive screening, a language battery and a disability questionnaire.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Timed_Up_and_Go_test	Timed Up and Go test	The Timed Up and Go test (TUG) is a simple test used to assess a person's mobility and requires both static and dynamic balance. It uses the time that a person takes to rise from a chair, walk three metres, turn around, walk back to the chair, and sit down. During the test, the person is expected to wear their regular footwear and use any mobility aids that they would normally require. The TUG is used frequently in the elderly population, as it is easy to administer and can generally be completed by most older adults. One source suggests that scores of ten seconds or less indicate normal mobility, 11 â€“ 20 seconds are within normal limits for frail elderly and disabled patients, and greater than 20 seconds means the person needs assistance outside and indicates further examination and intervention. A score of fourteen seconds or more suggests that the person may be prone to falls. Alternatively, a recommended practical cut-off value for the TUG to indicate normal versus below normal performance is 12 seconds. A study by Bischoff et al. showed the 10th to 90th percentiles for TUG performance were 6.0 to 11.2 seconds for community-dwelling women between 65 and 85 years of age, and determined that this population should be able to perform the TUG in 12 seconds or less. TUG performance has been found to decrease significantly with mobility impairments. Residential status and physical mobility status have been determined to be significant predictors of TUG performance. The TUG was developed from a more comprehensive test, the Get-Up and Go Test. Research has shown the Timed up and Go test has excellent interrater (intraclass correlation coefficient = .99) and intrarater reliability (ICC = .99). The test score also correlates well with gait speed (r = -55), scores on the Berg Balance Scale (r = -.72), and the Barthel Index (r = -.51). Many studies have shown good test-restest reliability in specific populations such as community-dwelling older adults and people with Parkinsonâ€™s disease.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stethoscope	Stethoscope	"The stethoscope is an acoustic medical device for auscultation, or listening to the internal sounds of an animal or human body. It is often used to listen to lung and heart sounds. It is also used to listen to intestines and blood flow in arteries and veins. In combination with a sphygmomanometer, it is commonly used for measurements of blood pressure. Less commonly, ""mechanic's stethoscopes"" are used to listen to internal sounds made by machines, such as diagnosing a malfunctioning automobile engine by listening to the sounds of its internal parts. Stethoscopes can also be used to check scientific vacuum chambers for leaks, and for various other small-scale acoustic monitoring tasks. A stethoscope that intensifies auscultatory sounds is called phonendoscope."

No device has yet entered the medical market, but, due to the prevalence of diabetes, it is the prime drive in the construction of fluorescent biosensors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vibroacoustic_stimulation	Vibroacoustic stimulation	Vibroacoustic stimulation is the application of a vibratory sound stimulus to the abdomen of a pregnant woman to induce FHR accelerations. The presence of FHR accelerations reliably predicts the absence of fetal metabolic acidemia. Vibroacoustic stimulation is typically used during a nonstress test (NST).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/KOH_test	KOH test	The KOH Test for Candida albicans, also known as a potassium hydroxide preparation or KOH prep, is a quick, inexpensive fungal test to differentiate between dermatophytes and Candida albicans symptoms from other skin disorders like psoriasis and eczema. Dermatophytes are a type of fungus that invades the top layer of the skin, hair, or nails. There are three genera of fungi commonly implicated: Trichophyton (found in skin, nail, and hair infections), Epidermophyton (skin and nail infections), and Microsporum (skin and hair infections). Dermatophytes produce an infection commonly known as ringworm or tinea. It can appear as â€œjock itchâ€ﾝ in the groin or inner thighs; on the scalp and hair resulting in brittle hair shafts that fall out easily. Tinea unguium affects the nails and athlete's foot (tinea pedis) affects the feet. Tinea versicolor refers to a fungal infection of the skin caused by Malassezia furfur. It appears anywhere on the skin and produces red or gray, scaly patches of itchy skin. Deeper infections may be discoloured, ulcerative and purulent. A Candida yeast infection can also be identified by a KOH test by taking scrapings from the mouth, vagina and skin. There are over 40 different fungus species known to cause disease in humans, of which Candida albicans is the most common and most frequently tested for.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lateral_flow_test	Lateral flow test	Lateral flow tests also known as Lateral Flow Immunochromatographic Assays are simple devices intended to detect the presence (or absence) of a target analyte in sample (matrix) without the need for specialized and costly equipment, though many lab based applications exist that are supported by reading equipment. Typically, these tests are used for medical diagnostics either for home testing, point of care testing, or laboratory use. A widely spread and well known application is the home pregnancy test. The technology is based on a series of capillary beds, such as pieces of porous paper or sintered polymer. Each of these elements has the capacity to transport fluid (e.g. , urine) spontaneously. The first element (the sample pad) acts as a sponge and holds an excess of sample fluid. Once soaked, the fluid migrates to the second element (conjugate pad) in which the manufacturer has stored the so-called conjugate, a dried format of bio-active particles (see below) in a salt-sugar matrix that contains eveything to guarantee an optimized chemical reaction between the target molecule (e.g. , an antigen) and its chemical partner (e.g. , antibody) that has been immobilized on the particle's surface. While the sample fluid dissolves the salt-sugar matrix, it also dissolves the particles and in one combined transport action the sample and conjugate mix while flowing through the porous structure. In this way, the analyte binds to the particles while migrating further through the third capillary bed. This material has one or more areas (often called stripes) where a third molecule has been immobilized by the manufacturer. By the time the sample-conjugate mix reaches these strips, analyte has been bound on the particle and the third 'capture' molecule binds the complex. After a while, when more and more fluid has passed the stripes, particles accumulate and the stripe-area changes color. Typically there are at least two stripes: one (the control) that captures any particle and thereby shows that reaction conditions and technology worked fine, the second contains a specific capture molecule and only captures those particles onto which an analyte molecule has been immobilized. After passing these reaction zones the fluid enters the final porous material, the wick, that simply acts as a waste container. Lateral Flow Tests can operate as either competitive or sandwich assays.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postcoital_test	Postcoital test	The postcoital test (PCT) is a test in the evaluation of infertility. It was apparently first performed by J. Marion Sims and later described by Max Huhner, thus it has also been called Sims-Huhner Test. The test examines interaction between sperm and mucus of the cervix. The PCT is scheduled close to ovulation when mucus is abundant, and the infertile couple is asked to have sexual intercourse. Several hours later, the woman is examined by the physician and the presence of active sperm in the mucus is recorded. Normally, active sperm are expected to be found as they can survive for many hours. A poor PCT may indicate sperm or mucus problems, including perhaps presence of immune factors that inactivate sperm. Also ovulatory problems and poor coital technique may affect the PCT. With the application of principles of evidence-based medicine the role of the PCT has been questioned and its use has become controversial.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Point-of-care_testing	Point-of-care testing	Point-of-care testing (POCT) is defined as medical testing at or near the site of patient care. The driving notion behind POCT is to bring the test conveniently and immediately to the patient. This increases the likelihood that the patient, physician, and care team will receive the results quicker, which allows for immediate clinical management decisions to be made. POCT includes: blood glucose testing, blood gas and electrolytes analysis, rapid coagulation testing(PT/INR,Alere, Microvisk Ltd), rapid cardiac markers diagnostics(TRIAGE,Alere), drugs of abuse screening, urine strips testing, pregnancy testing, fecal occult blood analysis, food pathogens screening, hemoglobin diagnostics, infectious disease testing and cholesterol screening. POCT is often accomplished through the use of transportable, portable, and handheld instruments and test kits (e.g. , CRP, HBA1C, Homocystein, HIV salivary assay, etc.). Small bench analyzers or fixed equipment can also be used when a handheld device is not availableâ€”the goal is to collect the specimen and obtain the results in a very short period of time at or near the location of the patient so that the treatment plan can be adjusted as necessary before the patient leaves. Cheaper, smaller, faster, and smarter POCT devices have increased the use of POCT approaches by making it cost-effective for many diseases, such as diabetes, carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) and acute coronary syndrome.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tympanometry	Tympanometry	Tympanometry is an examination used to test the condition of the middle ear and mobility of the eardrum and the conduction bones by creating variations of air pressure in the ear canal. Tympanometry is an objective test of middle-ear function. It is not a hearing test, but rather a measure of energy transmission through the middle ear. The test should not be used to assess the sensitivity of hearing and the results of this test should always be viewed in conjunction with pure tone audiometry. Tympanometry is a valuable component of the audiometric evaluation. In evaluating hearing loss, tympanometry permits a distinction between sensorineural and conductive hearing loss, when evaluation is not apparent via Weber and Rinne testing. Furthermore, in a primary care setting, tympanometry can be helpful in making the diagnosis of otitis media by demonstrating the presence of a middle ear effusion.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cystometry	Cystometry	Cystometry, also known as flow cystometry, is a clinical diagnostic procedure used to evaluate bladder function. Specifically, it measures contractile force of the bladder when voiding. The resulting chart generated from cystometric analysis is known as a cystometrogram (CMG), which plots volume of liquid emptied from bladder against intravesical pressure.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fluid_deprivation_test	Fluid deprivation test	A fluid or water deprivation test is a medical test which can be used to determine whether the patient has diabetes insipidus as opposed to other causes of polydipsia (a condition of excessive thirst that causes an excessive intake of water). The patient is required, for a prolonged period, to forgo intake of water completely, to determine the cause of the thirst. This test measures changes in body weight, urine output, and urine composition when fluids are withheld. Sometimes measuring blood levels of ADH (a synonym for vasopressin) during this test is also necessary. If there is no change in the water loss despite fluid deprivation, desmopressin may be administered to distinguish between the two types of diabetes insipidus which are central & nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. The time of deprivation may vary from 4 to 18 hours. The serum osmolality and urine osmolality are both measured in the test.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gastric_tonometry	Gastric tonometry	Gastric tonometry describes the measurement of the carbon dioxide level inside the stomach in order to assess the degree of blood flow to the stomach and bowel. Gastric Tonometry The measurement of gut mucosal carbon dioxide has been used to detect decreased blood flow. Accumulation of carbon dioxide is predominantly a result of hypoperfusion and not hypoxia. Because the introduction of a nasogastric tube is almost routine in critically ill patients, the measurement of gastric carbon dioxide can be an easy method to monitor tissue perfusion. The gastric mucosal pH is measured according to an equation that assumes that arterial bicarbonate is equal to intramucosal bicarbonate, an argument that is not always valid. Given that the gastric mucosal carbon dioxide is the directly measured value, whereas the gastric mucosal pH is the derived and possibly inaccurate value, studies that used gastric pH to monitor perfusion may be inherently flawed. Most studies have failed to effectively affect gastric pH and for this reason failed to produce improvements in outcome. One study, by Gutierrez and colleagues, has shown that therapeutic interventions guided by gastric tonometry improved survival in critically ill patients. In a direct comparison of splanchnic-oriented therapy as guided by gastric tonometry with conventional shock management of trauma patients, there was no difference in mortality rates, organ dysfunction rates, or length of stay. After a surge in popularity, the use of gastric tonometry waned and it is currently found with less frequency in surgical ICUs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phonocardiogram	Phonocardiogram	"A Phonocardiogram or PCG is a plot of high fidelity recording of the sounds and murmurs made by the heart with the help of the machine called phonocardiograph, or ""Recording of the sounds made by the heart during a cardiac cycle. "" The sounds are thought to result from vibrations created by closure of the heart valves. There are at least two: the first when the atrioventricular valves close at the beginning of systole and the second when the aortic valve closes at the end of systole. It allows the detection of subaudible sounds and murmurs, and makes a permanent record of these events. In contrast, the ordinary stethoscope cannot detect such sounds or murmurs, and provides no record of their occurrence. The ability to quantitate the sounds made by the heart provides information not readily available from more sophisticated tests, and provides vital information about the effects of certain cardiac drugs upon the heart. It is also an effective method for tracking the progress of the patient's disease. ]]"
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gold_standard_(test)	Gold standard (test)	For tests performed on actual gold, see Metallurgical assay. In medicine and statistics, gold standard test refers to a diagnostic test or benchmark that is the best available under reasonable conditions. It does not have to be necessarily the best possible test for the condition in absolute terms. For example, in medicine, dealing with conditions that require an autopsy to have a perfect diagnosis, the gold standard test is less accurate than the autopsy. Other times, gold standard is used to refer to the most accurate test possible without restrictions. The word is therefore ambiguous and its meaning should be deduced from the context in which it appears.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viral_load	Viral load	Viral load, also known as viral burden or viral titer, is a measure of the severity of a viral infection, and can be calculated by estimating the amount of virus in an involved body fluid. For example, it can be given in RNA copies per milliliter of blood plasma. Tracking viral load is used to monitor therapy during chronic viral infections, and in immunocompromised patients such as those recovering from bone marrow or solid organ transplantation. Currently, routine testing is available for HIV-1, cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and hepatitis C virus.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Evoked_potential	Evoked potential	"An evoked potential or evoked response is an electrical potential recorded from the nervous system of a human or other animal following presentation of a stimulus, as distinct from spontaneous potentials as detected by electroencephalography (EEG), electromyography (EMG), or other electrophysiological recording method. Evoked potential amplitudes tend to be low, ranging from less than a microvolt to several microvolts, compared to tens of microvolts for EEG, millivolts for EMG, and often close to a volt for ECG. To resolve these low-amplitude potentials against the background of ongoing EEG, ECG, EMG, and other biological signals and ambient noise, signal averaging is usually required. The signal is time-locked to the stimulus and most of the noise occurs randomly, allowing the noise to be averaged out with averaging of repeated responses. Signals can be recorded from cerebral cortex, brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerves. Usually the term ""evoked potential"" is reserved for responses involving either recording from, or stimulation of, central nervous system structures. Thus evoked compound motor action potentials (CMAP) or sensory nerve action potentials (SNAP) as used in nerve conduction studies (NCS) are generally not thought of as evoked potentials, though they do meet the above definition."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone_marrow_examination	Bone marrow examination	Bone marrow examination refers to the pathologic analysis of samples of bone marrow obtained by bone marrow biopsy (often called a trephine biopsy) and bone marrow aspiration. Bone marrow examination is used in the diagnosis of a number of conditions, including leukemia, multiple myeloma, lymphoma, anemia, and pancytopenia. The bone marrow produces the cellular elements of the blood, including platelets, red blood cells and white blood cells. While much information can be gleaned by testing the blood itself (drawn from a vein by phlebotomy), it is sometimes necessary to examine the source of the blood cells in the bone marrow to obtain more information on hematopoiesis; this is the role of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Screening_(medicine)	Screening (medicine)	Screening, in medicine, is a strategy used in a population to identify an unrecognised disease in individuals without signs or symptoms. This can include individuals with pre-symptomatic or unrecognised symptomatic disease. As such, screening tests are somewhat unique in that they are performed on persons apparently in good health. Screening interventions are designed to identify disease in a community early, thus enabling earlier intervention and management in the hope to reduce mortality and suffering from a disease. Although screening may lead to an earlier diagnosis, not all screening tests have been shown to benefit the person being screened; overdiagnosis, misdiagnosis, and creating a false sense of security are some potential adverse effects of screening. For these reasons, a test used in a screening program, especially for a disease with low incidence, must have good sensitivity in addition to acceptable specificity. Several types of screening exist: universal screening involves screening of all individuals in a certain category (for example, all children of a certain age). Case finding involves screening a smaller group of people based on the presence of risk factors (for example, because a family member has been diagnosed with a hereditary disease). Screening interventions are not designed to be diagnostic.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Perfusion_scanning	Perfusion scanning	Perfusion is defined as the passage of fluid through the lymphatic system or blood vessels to an organ or a tissue. The practice of perfusion scanning, is the process by which this perfusion can be observed, recorded and quantified. The term perfusion scanning encompasses a wide range of medical imaging modalities.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prausnitz-K%C3%BCstner_test	Prausnitz-KÃ¼stner test	The Prausnitz-KÃ¼stner test (PK test, Prausnitz-KÃ¼stner reaction) is an immunologic test formerly used by physicians to determine if a patient has an allergic reaction to a specific antigen. The test has been replaced by the safer skin prick test. The PK test involves transferring serum from the test subject to another healthy person, essentially using the second person as a mixing vessel for antibodies and antigen. This is a pathway for transmission of blood-borne diseases like Creutzfeldtâ€“Jakob disease, AIDS, and others, which is why the test is no longer recommended. Or in simple words, a test for the presence of immediate hypersensitivity in humans; test serum from an atopic individual is injected intradermally into a normal subject; the normal subject is challenged 24â€“48 hours later with the antigen suspected of causing the immediate hypersensitivity reaction in the atopic individual.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diagnostic_test	Diagnostic test	A diagnostic test is any kind of medical test performed to aid in the diagnosis or detection of disease. For example: to diagnose diseases, and preferably sub-classify it regarding, for example, severity and treatability to confirm that a person is free from disease Companion diagnostics have also been developed to preselect patients for specific treatments based on their own biology. Such targeted therapy holds great promise in the treatment of diseases such as cancer. A drug test can be a specific medical test to ascertain the presence of a certain drug in the body (for example, in drug addicts).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Contraction_stress_test	Contraction stress test	A contraction stress test (CST) is performed near the end of pregnancy to determine how well the fetus will cope with the contractions of childbirth. The aim is to induce contractions and monitor the fetus to check for heart rate abnormalities using a cardiotocograph.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Differential_staining	Differential staining	Differential Staining is a general term that can refer to a number of specific processes. Generally, it is used to describe staining processes which use more than one chemical stain. Using multiple stains can better differentiate between different microorganisms or structures/cellular components of a single organism. Differential Staining also describes medical process used to detect abnormalities in the proportion of different white blood cells in the blood. The process or results are called a WBC differential. This test is useful because many diseases alter the proportion of certain white blood cells. By analyzing these differences in combination with a clinical exam and other lab tests, medical professionals can diagnose disease. One commonly recognizable use of differential staining is the Gram stain. Gram staining uses two dyes: Crystal violet and Fuchsin (the counterstain) to differentiate between Gram-positive bacteria (large Peptidoglycan layer on outer surface of cell) and Gram-negative bacteria.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Differential_vascular_labeling	Differential vascular labeling	Differential Vascular Labeling is a labeling method that allows differentiation between blood and lymphatic systems for intravital imaging. This approach takes advantage of the differences in particle distribution across blood and lymphatic endothelia. The DVL is based on a single intravenous injection of a fluorescent particles of different size. Due to differential distribution of fluorescent particles by size the larger particles remain in blood whereas the smaller once diffuses out of blood and into the lymphatic system thus functionally labeling the vasculature. Vascular system differentiation by DVL allows for real-time observation of cell traffic across physiological barriers. DVL provides means to differential study the roles of angiogenesis and lymohangiogenesis in tumor metastasis. Lastly, DVL intrinsic fluid phase labeling allows a single-field fluid velocity analysis in intact vascular systems. Thus DVL allows for the simultaneous determination of fluid flow rates in diverse blood and lymphatic compartments and in newly formed tumor vessels.

Lungs require surfactant, a soap-like substance, to lower the surface pressure of the alveoli in the lungs. This is especially important for premature babies trying to expand their lungs after birth. Surfactant is a mixture of lipids, proteins, and glycoproteins, lecithin and sphingomyelin being two of them. Lecithin makes the surfactant mixture more effective.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inferior_petrosal_sinus_sampling	Inferior petrosal sinus sampling	Inferior petrosal sinus sampling is a relatively new approach to the diagnosis of Cushing's disease. In essence, it tests to see the source of the raised ACTH levels in a patient with Cushingoid features. The inferior petrosal sinus is where the pituitary gland drains. Therefore, a sample from here showing raised ACTH compared to the periphery suggests that it is a pituitary cause of Cushing's, i.e. Cushing's disease. In reality this test is performed following a Low dose dexamethasone suppression test. Increasingly, it is known as a gold-standard method for diagnosing Cushing's disease.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mechanography	Mechanography	Mechanography (also referred to as jumping mechanography) is a medical diagnostic measurement method for motion analysis by means of physical parameters. The variation of the ground reaction forces over the time of a motion like typical every day movements (e.g. chair rise or jumps) are measured and centre of gravity related physical parameters like relative maximum forces, velocity, power output, kinetic energy, potential energy, height of jump or whole body stiffness are calculated. If the ground reaction forces are measured separately for left and right leg in addition body imbalances during the motions can be analysed. This enables for example to document the results of therapy. The same methodology can also be used for gait analysis or for analysis of stair climbing.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Test_panel	Test panel	A test panel is a predetermined group of medical tests as an aid in the diagnosis and treatment of disease. Test panels (sometimes called profiles) are typically composed of individual laboratory tests which are related in some way: by the medical condition they are intended to help diagnose, by the specimen type, by the tests most frequently requested by users (comprehensive chemistry profile), by the methodology employed in the test (viral panel by polymerase chain reaction), or by the types of components included.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viral_culture	Viral culture	Viral culture is a laboratory test in which samples are placed with a cell type that the virus being tested for is able to infect. If the cells show changes, known as cytopathic effects, then the culture is positive. Traditional viral culture has been generally superseded by shell vial culture, in which the sample is centrifuged onto a single layer of cells and viral growth is measured by antigen detection methods. This greatly reduces the time to detection for slow growing viruses such as cytomegalovirus, for which the method was developed. In addition, the centrifugation step in shell vial culture enhances the sensitivity of this method because after centrifugation, the viral particles of the sample are in close proximity to the cells. Human and monkey cells are used in both traditional viral culture and shell vial culture. Human virus types that can be identified by viral culture include adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, enteroviruses, herpes simplex virus, influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, varicella zoster virus, measles and mumps. For these, the final identification method is generally by immunofluorescence, with exception of cytomegalovirus and rhinovirus, whose identification in a viral culture are determined by cytopathic effects.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flatline	Flatline	A flatline is an electrical time sequence measurement that shows no activity and therefore when represented, shows a flat line instead of a moving one. It almost always refers to either a flatlined electrocardiogram, where the heart shows no electrical activity, or to a flat electroencephalogram, in which the brain shows no electrical activity. Both of these specific cases are involved in various definitions of death. Some consider one who has flatlined to be clinically dead, regardless of eventual resuscitation or lack thereof, whereas others insist that one is alive until the moment of brain death. This is mostly used in the medical industry when a person's pulse has stopped, indicating a flat line on the heart monitor. When a patient displays a cardiac flatline, the treatment of choice is an injection of vasopressin (epinephrine and atropine are also possibilities) and chest compressions. Successful resuscitation is generally unlikely and is inversely related to the length of time spent attempting resuscitation. Despite defibrillation commonly appearing on medical dramas as a remedy for asystole, it is usually not done when there is a total absence of electrical activity, as it could actually make it more difficult to restart the heart. A flatline will also be generated if all leads are disconnected from the patient.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serum-ascites_albumin_gradient	Serum-ascites albumin gradient	The serum-ascites albumin gradient or gap (SAAG) is a calculation used in medicine to help determine the cause of ascites. The SAAG may be a better discriminant than the older method of classifying ascites fluid as a transudate versus exudate. The formula is as follows: SAAG = - (albumin concentration of ascitic fluid). Ideally, the two values should be measured at the same time. This phenomenon is the result of Starling's forces between the fluid of the circulatory system and ascitic fluid. Under normal circumstances the SAAG is < 1.1 because serum oncotic pressure (pulling fluid back into circulation) is exactly counterbalanced by the serum hydrostatic pressure (which pushes fluid out of the circulatory system). This balance is disturbed in certain diseases (such as the Budd-Chiari syndrome, heart failure, or liver cirrhosis) that increase the hydrostatic pressure in the circulatory system. The increase in hydrostatic pressure causes more fluid to leave the circulation into the peritoneal space (ascites). The SAAG subsequently increases because there is more free fluid leaving the circulation, diluting the albumin in the ascitic fluid. The albumin does not move across membrane spaces easily because it is a large molecule.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mechanomyogram	Mechanomyogram	The mechanomyogram (MMG) is the mechanical signal observable from the surface of a muscle when the muscle is contracted. At the onset of muscle contraction, gross changes in the muscle shape cause a large peak in the MMG. Subsequent vibrations are due to oscillations of the muscle fibres at the resonance frequency of the muscle. The mechanomyogram is also known as the phonomyogram, acoustic myogram, sound myogram or vibromyogram.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bedside_test	Bedside test	Bedside tests are simple medical blood tests which can be performed at the bedside. Simple tests such as those found in medical examinations, urine dip stick tests and even simple imaging such as with a portable ultrasound device. As well as regular observations such as ECG's, O2 saturation and heart rate. The most important Bedside test is the classification of the Blood type ahead of a Blood transfusion.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nardi_test	Nardi test	The Nardi test, also known as the morphine-neostigmine provocation test is a test for dysfunction of the sphincter of Oddi, a valve which divides the biliary tract from the duodenum. Two medications, morphine and neostigmine, are given to people with symptoms concerning for sphincter dysfunction, including sharp right-sided abdominal pain. If the pain is reproduced by the medications, then dysfunction is more likely. The test poorly predicts dysfunction, however, and is rarely used today. The Nardi test was named for George Nardi, who first described the procedure in 1966.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rivalta_test	Rivalta test	"""Rivaltaâ€™s testâ€ﾝ is a very simple, inexpensive method that does not require special laboratory equipment and can be easily performed in private practice. This test was originally developed by the Italian researcher Rivalta around 1900 and was used to differentiate transudates and exudates in human patients. This test is very useful in cats to differentiate between effusions due to FIP and effusions caused by other diseases [Hartmann et al, 2003]. Not only the high protein content, but high concentrations of fibrinogen and inflammatory mediators lead to a positive reaction. Rivalta test is used in order to differentiate a transudate from an exudate. A test tube is filled with distilled water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to be tested is added. If the drop dissipates, the test is negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the test is positive, indicating an exudate. Using a pH 4.0 acetic acid solution, 8 types of proteins were identified in Rivalta reaction-positive turbid precipitates: C-reactive protein (CRP), Alpha 1-antitrypsin (alpha1-AT), Orosomucoid, haptoglobin (Hp), transferrin (Tf), ceruloplasmin (Cp), fibrinogen (Fg), and hemopexin (Hpx). Since those are Acute-phase proteins, a positive Rivalta's test may be suggestive of inflammation."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secretin-cholecystokinin_test	Secretin-cholecystokinin test	The secretin-cholecystokinin test (secretin-CCK test) is a combination of the secretin test and the cholecystokinin test and is used to assess the function of both the pancreas and gall bladder. Cholecystokinin, a hormone secreted by the APUD cells located in the proximal mucosa of the small intestine is administered intravenously, this stimulates the pancreatic secretion of the digestive enzymes amylase, trypsin, and lipase. These are measured by a catheter placed in the duodenum. Cholecystokinin also stimulates the flow of bile and causes the gall bladder to contract and thus determine if the gall bladder is emptying properly. It also affects the esophageal sphincter and the sphincter of Oddi by reducing contraction as well as increasing motility (movement) of the stomach and intestine. The CCK test may be administered in conjunction with an ultrasound test to visually monitor gall bladder contraction. While the test is usually administered in a supine position Dr. William Smedley of Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania has detected previously missed gallbladder abnormalities by administering the test in an erect position. The concentration and output of bicarbonate with the secretin-CCK test is similar to what has been observed with the standard secretin test . The secretin-induced rapid flow of water results in lower and often unreliable enzyme concentrations. CCK also induces gallbladder contraction and the release of bile, which may further dilute enzyme concentrations. As a result, the quantification of total enzyme output (units/min) must be determined through continuous collection of duodenal fluid with or without the use of perfusion markers. Measurement of more than one enzyme and bicarbonate may improve sensitivity since some patients may possess deficiencies of one parameter and not the others . One study reviewed the relative diagnostic value of enzyme and bicarbonate concentrations compared with enzyme output in 363 secretin-CCK tests . The investigators also evaluated the requirement for perfusion markers to accurately quantify volume, and the validity of a shortened sampling time (first 20 minutes). Only 60 percent of volume was recovered with the duodenal aspiration tube, suggesting that marker perfusion to correct for distal loss of secretion is important to accurately quantify volume. Using a trypsin output <50 U/kg/h as the reference standard, measurement of enzyme concentration alone misclassified approximately 10 percent of patients. Use of a shortened collection time misclassified approximately 4 percent of patients. The authors concluded that this was an unacceptably high rate of misclassification and that the standard prolonged collection of fluid using a perfusion marker must be performed to accurately measure exocrine function.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Postage_stamp_test	Postage stamp test	The Postage stamp test is a test used to evaluate nocturnal erections in a workup of male impotence. A length of connected postage stamps connected by perforations that allow easy tearing are secured loosely around the male's flaccid penis just prior to sleeping. If the perforated connections between the individual stamps are torn upon awakening, this is taken as evidence of nocturnal tumescence.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronchoalveolar_lavage	Bronchoalveolar lavage	Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is a medical procedure in which a bronchoscope is passed through the mouth or nose into the lungs and fluid is squirted into a small part of the lung and then recollected for examination. BAL is typically performed to diagnose lung disease. In particular, BAL is commonly used to diagnose infections in people with immune system problems, pneumonia in people on ventilators, some types of lung cancer, and scarring of the lung. BAL is the most common manner to sample the components of the epithelial lining fluid (ELF) and to determine the protein composition of the pulmonary airways, and it is often used in immunological research as a means of sampling cells or pathogen levels in the lung. Examples of these include T-cell populations and influenza viral levels.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinder_spot_test	Trinder spot test	The Trinder spot test is a diagnostic test used in medicine to determine exposure to salicylates, particularly to salicylic acid. The test employs the Trinder reagent (a.k.a. Trinder solution) which is mixed with a patient's urine. The colour change, resulting from the Trinder reaction, is immediate, enabling rapid bedside assessment. The Trinder solution/reagent is a pre-mixed solution of 10% ferric chloride. It can be prepared by combining 40 g of mercuric chloride and 40 g of ferric nitrate in 850 ml of type II deionized water, and then adding 10 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid to the solution and diluting to a volume of 1 litre with more type II deionized water. The test for the Trinder reaction is to mix 1 ml of urine with 1 ml of the Trinder reagent in a test tube. The test is positive if a colour change results. The specific colour changes are: blue or purplepositive test no changenegative test brownfalse-positive test caused by the presence of phenothiazines The test has a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 74% for identifying patients whose salicylate concentrations are greater than 30Â mg per decilitre (2.17Â mmol/L). False positive concentrations (2.8 to 14.3Â mg per decilitre) have been reported to occur in neonates with hyperbilirubinemia, premature neonates, and children who are seriously ill (e.g. children who have extensive burns). The reaction between iron(III) and pharmaceuticals was first adapted for clinical use by P. Trinder (after whom the test, reaction, and reagent are now named), of the Biochemistry Department of the Royal Infirmary in Sunderland, in 1954 (see the article listed in further reading). Salicyclic acid, salicylamide, and methylsalicylate all reach with iron(III) via the phenol group which is next to their â€“COOH, â€“CONH2, or â€“COOCH3 functions. The Trinder reaction has been used for the determination of the presence of oxytetracycline in 1991, of ciprofloxacin in 1992, and of norfloxacin in 1993, in each case using a solution of iron(III) in suplphuric acid. It has also been used for the determination of the presence of bromazepan in 1992, using an iron(II) solution in a hydrochloric acid rather than an iron(III) solution.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sucrose_gap	Sucrose gap	The sucrose gap technique is used to create a conduction block in nerve or muscle fibers. A high concentration of sucrose is applied to the extracellular space to increase resistance between two groups of cells, which prevents the correct opening and closing of sodium and potassium channels. It was originally developed by Robert StÃ¤mpfli for recording action potentials in nerve fibers, and is particularly useful for measuring irreversible or highly variable pharmacological modifications of channel properties since untreated regions of membrane can be pulled into the node between the sucrose regions.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saliva_testing	Saliva testing	Saliva testing is a diagnostic technique that involves laboratory analysis of saliva to identify markers of endocrine, immunologic, inflammatory, infectious, and other types of conditions. Saliva is a useful biological fluid for assaying steroid hormones such as cortisol, genetic material like RNA, proteins such as enzymes and antibodies, and a variety of other substances. Saliva testing is used to screen for or diagnose numerous conditions and disease states, including Cushing's disease, anovulation, HIV, cancer, parasites, hypogonadism, and allergies. Salivary testing has even been used by the U.S. government to assess circadian rhythm shifts in astronauts before flight and to evaluate hormonal profiles of soldiers undergoing military survival training. Proponents of saliva testing cite its ease of collection, safety, non-invasiveness, affordability, accuracy, and capacity to circumvent venipuncture as the primary advantages when compared to blood testing and other types of diagnostic testing. Additionally, since multiple samples can be readily obtained, saliva testing is particularly useful for performing chronobiological assessments that span hours, days, or weeks. Salivary testing has been used for three decades. Initial studies focused primarily on detection of steroid hormones and antibodies in the saliva. Recent applications emphasize the development of increasingly sophisticated techniques to detect additional proteins, genetic material, and markers of nutritional status. According to Wong, scientists are now viewing saliva as â€œa valuable biofluidâ€¦with the potential to extract more data than is possible currently with other diagnostic methods. â€ﾝ
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fern_test	Fern test	Fern test refers to visualization of a characteristic 'fern-like' pattern on a slide (pre-cleaned, saline free slides are required), viewed under low power on a microscope: 1. a small amount of cervical mucus is allowed to air-dry on a clean, saline-free glass slide. In the presence of high levels of estrogen, just prior to ovulation, the cervical mucus forms fern-like patterns due to crystallization of sodium chloride on mucus fibers. The Fern test is used to provide indirect evidence of ovulation and fertility, however this test does not predict the time of ovulation. Ferning is due to the presence of sodium chloride in the mucus under estrogen effect. This pattern is known as arborization or 'ferning'. When the influence of estrogen starts to decline while that of progesterone increases, the arborization pattern becomes ill-defined. It is completely absent during the pre- and postmen-strual phase (22nd day of cycle). Persistence of Ferning throughout menstrual cycle suggests an-ovulation (infertility). This is also true after menopause, and in autonomic ovarian failure. While the dried mucus is being examined for arborization, the leukocyte content of the mucus should also be assessed. Leukocytes are abundant during the early proliferative phase and luteal phase, but sparse at ovulation due to the influence of estrogen. Any deviation from this pattern is justification for a bacteriologic study, perhaps with a resistance test. From http://www. euromedcenter. org. ge/eng/ginekologia_01. html 2. To verify the presence of amniotic fluid where membrane rupture is suspected, ferning permits positive identification of amniotic fluid by its fern-type crystallization. It permits a rapid and certain differential diagnosis between leukorrhea, hydrorrhea, urinary incontinence and spontaneous amniotomy. The crystallization test was shown to be most reliable and the few sources of error are easily avoided. The test is inhibited by cellular debris or blood when it is in a concentration greater than 1:10. Centrifugation permits the reappearance of fern-leaf crystallization. The typical image resembles that of the crystallization of cervical mucus. However, amniotic fluid crystallizes on the entire smear, whereas mucus crystallizes in a linear fashion. Cervical mucus crystallization is normally absent during pregnancy. It may occur in cases of threatened abortion. The authors have performed the test in combination with a nitrazin paper test in a series of 192 patients. In their hands it has given nearly perfect results.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surround_Optical_Fiber_Immunoassay	Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay	Surround optical fiber immunoassay (SOFIA) is an ultrasensitive, in vitro diagnostic platform incorporating a surround optical fiber assembly that captures fluorescence emissions from an entire sample. The technology's defining characteristics are its extremely high limit of detection, sensitivity and dynamic range. SOFIAâ€™s sensitivity is measured at the attogram level (10g), making it approximately one billion times more sensitive than conventional diagnostic techniques. Based on its enhanced dynamic range, SOFIA is able to discriminate levels of analyte in a sample over 10 orders of magnitude facilitating accurate titering. As a diagnostic platform, SOFIA has a broad range of applications. Several studies have already demonstrated SOFIAâ€™s unprecedented ability to detect naturally occurring prions in the blood and urine of disease carriers. This is expected to lead to the first reliable ante mortem screening test for vCJD, BSE, scrapie, CWD, and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Given the technologyâ€™s extreme sensitivity, additional unique applications are anticipated, including in vitro tests for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s. SOFIA was developed as a result of a joint-collaborative research project between Los Alamos National Laboratory and State University of New York, and was supported by the Department of Defense's National Prion Research Program. Its ongoing development is being spearheaded by Bionosis, Inc. , a private-sector biotechnology company.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Esophageal_pH_monitoring	Esophageal pH monitoring	Esophageal pH monitoring is the current gold standard for diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It provides direct physiologic measurement of acid in the esophagus and is the most objective method to document reflux disease, assess the severity of the disease and monitor the response of the disease to medical or surgical treatment. It can also be used in diagnosing laryngopharyngeal reflux.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pap_test	Pap test	The Papanicolaou test (also called Pap smear, Pap test, cervical smear, or smear test) is a screening test used to detect potentially pre-cancerous and cancerous processes in the endocervical canal (transformation zone) of the female reproductive system. Unusual findings are often followed up by more sensitive diagnostic procedures, and, if warranted, interventions that aim to prevent progression to cervical cancer. The test was invented by and named after the prominent Greek doctor Georgios Papanikolaou. In taking a Pap smear, a speculum is used to open the vaginal canal and allow the collection of cells from the outer opening of the cervix of the uterus and the endocervix. The cells are examined under a microscope to look for abnormalities. The test aims to detect potentially pre-cancerous changes (called cervical intraepithelial neoplasia or cervical dysplasia), which are usually caused by sexually transmitted human papillomaviruses. The test remains an effective, widely used method for early detection of pre-cancer and cervical cancer. The test may also detect infections and abnormalities in the endocervix and endometrium. In general, in countries where Pap smear screening is routine, it is recommended that females who have had sex seek regular Pap smear testing. Guidelines on frequency vary from every three to five years. If results are abnormal, and depending on the nature of the abnormality, the test may need to be repeated in six to twelve months. If the abnormality requires closer scrutiny, the patient may be referred for detailed inspection of the cervix by colposcopy. The patient may also be referred for HPV DNA testing, which can serve as an adjunct to Pap testing. Additional biomarkers which may be applied as ancillary test with Pap test are evolving.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thoracentesis	Thoracentesis	Thoracentesis, (from Greek, thorax + centesis, puncture) also known as thoracocentesis or pleural tap, is an invasive procedure to remove fluid or air from the pleural space for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. A cannula, or hollow needle, is carefully introduced into the thorax, generally after administration of local anesthesia. The procedure was first described in 1852. The recommended location varies depending upon the source. It is critical that the patient hold his or her breath to avoid piercing of the lung. Some sources recommend the midaxillary line, in the sixth, seventh, or eighth intercostal space. Whenever possible, the procedure should be performed under ultrasound guidance, which has shown to reduce complications.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bloodletting	Bloodletting	"Bloodletting (or blood-letting) is the withdrawal of often small quantities of blood from a patient to cure or prevent illness and disease. Bloodletting was based on an ancient system of medicine in which blood and other bodily fluid were regarded as ""humors"" that had to remain in proper balance to maintain health. It was the most common medical practice performed by physicians from antiquity until the late 19th century, a span of almost 2,000 years. The practice has now been abandoned for all except a few very specific conditions. It is conceivable that historically, in the absence of other treatments for hypertension, bloodletting could sometimes have had a beneficial effect in temporarily reducing blood pressure by reducing blood volume. However, since hypertension is very often asymptomatic and thus undiagnosable without modern methods, this effect was unintentional. In the overwhelming majority of cases, the historical use of bloodletting was harmful to patients. Today, the term phlebotomy refers to the drawing of blood for laboratory analysis or blood transfusion. Therapeutic phlebotomy refers to the drawing of a unit of blood in specific cases like hemochromatosis, polycythemia vera, porphyria cutanea tarda, etc. , to reduce the amount of red blood cells."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesion-specific_calcium_score	Lesion-specific calcium score	The lesion-specific calcium score is a method of calcium measurement that results from a CT test for coronary artery calcification. Coronary disease, which most often is equated with atherosclerotic coronary artery disease, has been identified as the leading cause of death worldwide. The initial presentation of coronary artery disease in half of all patients presents in sudden cardiac death outside of the hospital most often resulting in the patientâ€™s death. Early detection is critical in order to implement early lifestyle changes and early therapies to prevent major adverse coronary events. The most commonly used screening method for coronary disease is CT based coronary artery calcium quantification based on Agatston method, which was developed by Arthur Agatston. The Agatston score development was based upon the quantification of total coronary artery calcium in the entire heart for purposes of early detection and risk assessment. The whole-heart Agatston score has been shown to be independent to traditional risk factors; however, the overall predictive accuracy is relatively modest as it does not take into consideration the spatial distribution and regional characteristics of individual calcified lesions. Furthermore, because it lacks spatial distribution information it cannot distinguish between plaque located in high risk areas versus low risk areas. In 2008, Dr. Szilard Voros and his team began their investigation of the relationship between coronary calcification in the presence of blockages in the heart. This investigation led to the concept of the lesion-specific calcium score. Voros, Dr. Zhen Qian and their team introduced this concept where each individual calcified lesion is characterized and precisely measured using parameters including but not limited to the width, length, density, and distance from the entrance of the major coronary arteries. Research has shown that the lesion-specific calcium scoring method is superior to the traditional Agatston score for the prediction of significant blockages in the heart. The lesion-specific calcium score has been filed under US and international patent protection.

TNE may also be useful in detecting Barrett's, but there is incongruence between TNE findings and biopsy results. Experts in the field suggest that TNE may replace radiographic imaging of the esophagus in otolaryngology patients with reflux, globus, and dysphagia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tecumseh_step_test	Tecumseh step test	The Tecumseh step test is a modified version of the Harvard Step Test developed by Professor Henry J. Montoye. The main differences from the original protocol were the lower step height (8Â inches instead of 20), the more moderate stepping rate (24 steps/min instead of 30) and the shorter duration (3 minutes instead of 5 minutes). These alterations made this test easier to perform and suitable for epidemiological studies. In fact, this modified step test was employed in the Tecumseh, Michigan, Community Health Study run between the 50â€™s and 60â€™s. During this epidemiological study around 5,488 people performed the Tecumseh Step test. The number of heart beats from 30 seconds after the end of the 3 minutes step test to 1 minute after the step test were used to assess the cardiovascular fitness level.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ballistocardiography	Ballistocardiography	The ballistocardiograph (BCG) is a measure of ballistic forces on the heart. Ballistocardiography is a technique for producing a graphical representation of repetitive motions of the human body arising from the sudden ejection of blood into the great vessels with each heart beat. It is a vital sign in the 1-20 Hz frequency range which is caused by the mechanical movement of the heart and can be recorded by noninvasive methods from the surface of the body. It was shown for the first time, after an extensive research work by Dr. Isaac Starr, that the effect of main heart malfunctions can be identified by observing and analyzing the BCG signal. One Example of the use of a BCG is a ballistocardiographic scale, which measures the recoil of the persons body who is on the scale. A BCG scale is able to show a persons heart rate as well as their weight. The term ballistocardiograph originated from the Roman ballista, which is derived from the Greek word ballein (to throw), a machine for launching missiles, plus the Greek word for heart and writing.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Temperature_measurement	Temperature measurement	Attempts of standardized temperature measurement have been reported as early as 170 AD by Claudius Galenus. The modern scientific field has its origins in the works by Florentine scientists in the 17th century. Early devices to measure temperature were called thermoscopes. The first sealed thermometer was constructed in 1641 by the Grand Duke of Toscani, Ferdinand II. The development of today's thermometers and temperature scales began in the early 18th century, when Gabriel Fahrenheit adapted a thermometer using mercury and a scale both developed by Ole Christensen RÃ¸mer. Fahrenheit's scale is still in use, alongside the Celsius scale and the Kelvin scale.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Autoinoculation	Autoinoculation	"Autoinoculation is derived from the Latin root words ""autos"" and ""inoculate"" that mean ""self implanting"" or ""self infection"" or ""implanting something from oneself"". Autoinoculation can refer to both beneficial medical procedures as well as non-beneficial or harmful natural processes. One beneficial autoinoculation medical procedure is when cells are removed from a person's body, medically altered then reinserted (""implanted"" or ""infected"") into the same organism or person again to achieve some diagnostic or treatment aim. For example stem cell treatments involve the harvesting of stem cells from one's own bone marrow and reintroduction (autoinoculation) of those cells at a later date, sometimes after altering those stem cells. Autoinoculation can also refer to the process by which viruses reproduce themselves within an organism by implanting themselves in an organism's cells, altering the metabolism, DNA repair, and replication processes of those cells, using those processes to reproduce and transmit itself throughout the organism. For example warts and Molluscum contagiosum can be spread by this method if wart tissue cells (skin cells altered by a papillomavirus) are mechanically transported to another part of the body. This transmission or autoinoculation of the wart can occur by mechanical touching of one part of the organism to another, friction that removes a portion of the infected cells to an external surface (or another organism) and then reintroduces those cells upon contact with the body elsewhere, or when wart cells or tissue are transported though the blood stream of an organism."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impedance_phlebography	Impedance phlebography	Impedance phlebography, or impedance plethysmography (IPG), is a non-invasive medical test that measures small changes in electrical resistance of the chest, calf or other regions of the body. These measurements reflect blood volume changes, and can indirectly indicate the presence or absence of venous thrombosis. This procedure provides an alternative to venography, which is invasive and requires a great deal of skill to execute adequately and interpret accurately. For the chest, the technique was developed by NASA to measure the split second impedance changes within the chest, as the heart beats, to calculate both cardiac output and lung water content. This technique has progressed clinically (often now called BioZ, i.e. biologic impedance, as promoted by the leading manufacturer in the US) and allows low cost, non-invasive estimations of cardiac output and total peripheral resistance, using only 4 skin electrodes, oscillometric blood pressure measurement and lung water volumes with minimal removal of clothing in physician offices having the needed equipment. For leg veins, the test measures blood volume in the lower leg due to temporary venous obstruction. This is accomplished by inflating a pneumatic cuff around the thigh to sufficient pressure to cut off venous flow but not arterial flow, causing the venous blood pressure to rise until it equals the pressure under the cuff. When the cuff is released there is a rapid venous runoff and a prompt return to the resting blood volume. Venous thrombosis will alter the normal response to temporary venous obstruction in a highly characteristic way, causing a delay in emptying of the venous system after the release of the tourniquet. The increase in blood volume after cuff inflation is also usually diminished.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Predictive_testing	Predictive testing	Predictive testing is a form of genetic testing. It is also known as presymptomatic testing. These types of testing are used to detect gene mutations associated with disorders that appear after birth, often later in life. These tests can be helpful to people who have a family member with a genetic disorder, but who have no features of the disorder themselves at the time of testing. Predictive testing can identify mutations that increase a person's risk of developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. For example, an individual with a mutation in BRCA1 has a 65% cumulative risk of breast cancer. Presymptomatic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. The results of predictive and presymptomatic testing can provide information about a personâ€™s risk of developing a specific disorder and help with making decisions about medical care.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boston_Diagnostic_Aphasia_Examination	Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination	"The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination or BDAE is a test used to evaluate adults suspected of having aphasia, and is currently in its third edition. It was created by Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. The BDAE evaluates language skills based on perceptual modalities (auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (writing, articulation, and manipulation). Administration time ranges from 35 to 45 minutes. Many other tests are sometimes used by neurologists and speech language pathologists on a case-by-case basis, and other comprehensive tests exist like the Western Aphasia Battery. Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination Purpose: Designed as a comprehensive measure of aphasia. Population: Adults. Score: Percentiles or standard scores for the subtests. Time: (180) minutes. Authors: Harold Goodglass and Edith Kaplan. Publisher: The Psychological Corporation. Description: The Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is a comprehensive, multifactorial battery designed to evaluate a broad range of language impairments that often arise as a consequence of organic brain dysfunction. The Examination is designed to go beyond simple functional definitions of aphasia into the components of language dysfunctions (symptoms) that have been shown to underlie the various aphasic syndromes. Thus, this test evaluates various perceptual modalities (e.g. , auditory, visual, and gestural), processing functions (e.g. , comprehension, analysis, problem-solving), and response modalities (e.g. , writing, articulation, and manipulation). This approach allows for the neuropsychological analysis and measurement of language-related skills and abilities from both ideographic and nomothetic bases, as well as a comprehensive approach to the symptom configurations that relate to neuropathologic conditions. Scoring: The manual provides clear statements and rules for scoring protocols. Reliability: Reliability of the subtests was studied by selecting protocols of 34 patients with a degree of severity of aphasia ranging from slight to severe. Kuder-Richardson reliability coefficients for subtests ranged from .68 to .98, with about two-thirds of the coefficients reported ranging from .90 upwards. Since test-retest reliability is difficult if not impossible to attain with patients suffering from aphasic symptoms, the current reliability coefficients demonstrate very good internal consistency in terms of what the items within the subtests are measuring. Validity: A discriminant analysis comparing ""unambiguous exemplars of a single syndrome"" was carried out. Thus, unambiguous cases of Brocaâ€™s aphasia, Wernickeâ€™s aphasia, conduction aphasia, and anomic aphasia were selected. Ten variables were selected on the assumption of providing the most useful data. From these, five variables were selected for the discriminant analysis (body part identification, repetition of high probability sentences, verbal paraphasias, articulatory agility rating, and automated sentence rating). This classification yielded no misclassifications. Norms: Standardization of the revised Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination is based on a normative sample of 242 patients with aphasic symptoms tested at the Boston VA Medical Center between 1976-1982. It is important to consider that this sample includes only male, presumably English-speaking patients and is thus highly selected. Suggested Uses: Designed for the assessment of aphasia for inpatient or outpatient populations."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kirby-Bauer_antibiotic_testing	Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing	Kirby-Bauer antibiotic testing (KB testing or disk diffusion antibiotic sensitivity testing) is a test which uses antibiotic-impregnated wafers to test whether particular bacteria are susceptible to specific antibiotics. A known quantity of bacteria are grown on agar plates in the presence of thin wafers containing relevant antibiotics. If the bacteria are susceptible to a particular antibiotic, an area of clearing surrounds the wafer where bacteria are not capable of growing (called a zone of inhibition). This along with the rate of antibiotic diffusion are used to estimate the bacteria's sensitivity to that particular antibiotic. In general, larger zones correlate with smaller minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of antibiotic for that bacteria. This information can be used to choose appropriate antibiotics to combat a particular infection.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannabis_drug_testing	Cannabis drug testing	Cannabis drug testing describes various drug test methodologies for the use of cannabis in medicine, sport, and law. Cannabis use is highly detectable and can be detected by urinalysis, hair analysis, as well as saliva tests for days or weeks. Unlike alcohol, for which impairment can be reasonably measured using a breathalyser (and confirmed with a blood alcohol content measurement), valid detection for cannabis is time-consuming, and tests cannot determine an approximate degree of impairment. The lack of suitable tests and agreed-upon intoxication levels is an issue in the legality of cannabis debate, especially regarding intoxicated driving. The concentrations obtained from such analyses can often be helpful in distinguishing active use from passive exposure, elapsed time since use, and extent or duration of use. The Duquenois-Levine test is commonly used as a screening test in the field, but it cannot definitively confirm the presence of cannabis, as a large range of substances have been shown to give false positives.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Harvard_Step_Test	Harvard Step Test	The Harvard Step Test is a type of cardiac stress test for detecting and/or diagnosing cardiovascular disease. It also is a good measurement of fitness, and your ability to recover after a strenuous exercise. The more quickly your heart rate returns to resting, the better shape you are in. It is a kind of cardiovascular endurance test. The test computes the capability to exercise continuously for extended intervals of time without tiring. The subject (person who is taking the test) steps up and down on a platform at a height of about 45Â cm. at a rate of 30 steps per minute for 5 minutes or until exhaustion. Exhaustion is the point at which the subject cannot maintain the stepping rate for 15 seconds. The subject immediately sits down on completion of the test, and the heartbeats are counted for 1 to 1.5, 2 to 2.5, and 3 to 3.5 minutes. The test was developed at Harvard University in 1943. Several modified versions of the original Harvard Step test exist; an example is the Tecumseh step test. Another modified version, the Sharkey step test, was developed in the 1970s for use by the United States Forest Service at the University of Montana in Missoula.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multifocal_technique	Multifocal technique	Multifocal techniques are used in electroretinogram and visual evoked potential recordings to separate the responses originating from the stimulation of different locations in the visual field (and thus different retinal locations). The concept is as follows: Each visual field location is stimulated with a stimulus sequence that is uncorrelated to the sequences used for the other locations. All visual field locations are stimulated in parallel with their individual stimulus sequence. The retinal or cortical activity, which is a mixture of the responses from all visual field locations, is recorded with usual electroretinographic or visual evoked potential methods, respectively. Due to the independence of the stimulus sequences, the responses for each visual field location can be extracted using mathematical algorithms. Mutifocal techniques, in particular the multifocal ERG, are used in the diagnosis of ophthalmological diseases.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oncotype_DX_Colon_Cancer_Assay	Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay	The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay, developed by Genomic Health, is a genomic test that has been clinically available for patients with newly diagnosed stage II colon cancer since January 2010. The test is a validated diagnostic assay based on an individual patientâ€™s colon tumor expression of 12 genes, which quantifies the likelihood of recurrence in stage II colon cancer following surgery. The result from the assay is a continuous Recurrence Score value from 0 to 100 that corresponds to a specific likelihood of colon cancer recurrence 3 years after surgery. A lower score corresponds to a lower risk of recurrence, and a higher score corresponds to a higher risk of recurrence. The Recurrence Score result provides additional information on recurrence risk beyond traditional clinical and pathological characteristics such as tumor stage (T-stage), mismatch repair (MMR) status, number of lymph nodes examined, tumor grade and lymphovascular invasion . The Oncotype DX Colon Cancer Assay has the greatest utility for the stage II colon cancer patients with T3 and MMR proficient tumors. The Oncotype DX assay is a non-invasive test that is performed on a small amount of the tissue removed during surgery, which means no additional invasive procedure is required. After the surgical procedure, the tissue sample is fixed (usually in formalin) and embedded in paraffin so it can be preserved for diagnostic testing. To perform Oncotype DX test, a pathologist will send the tumor block or several thin sections of the tissue sample to Genomic Health. Genomic Health uses a laboratory process known as RT-PCR to measure the expression of the 12-gene panel.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Genetic_testing	Genetic testing	Genetic testing (also called DNA-based tests) is among the newest and most sophisticated of techniques used to test for genetic disorders which involves direct examination of the DNA molecule itself. Other genetic tests include biochemical tests for such gene products as enzymes and other proteins and for microscopic examination of stained or fluorescent chromosomes. Genetic tests are used for several reasons, including: identifying unaffected individuals who carry one copy of a gene for a disease that requires two copies for the disease to be expressed, for example Huntington's disorder. preimplantation genetic diagnosis prenatal diagnostic testing newborn screening Genealogical DNA test (for genetic genealogy purposes) presymptomatic testing for predicting adult-onset disorders such as Huntington's disease presymptomatic testing for estimating the risk of developing adult-onset cancers and Alzheimer's disease confirmational diagnosis of a symptomatic individual forensic/identity testing Genetic testing allows the genetic diagnosis of vulnerabilities to inherited diseases, and can also be used to determine a child's paternity (genetic father) or a person's ancestry. Normally, every person carries two copies of every gene (with the exception of genes related to sex-linked traits, which are only inherited from the mother by males), one inherited from their mother, one inherited from their father. The human genome is believed to contain around 20,000 - 25,000 genes. In addition to studying chromosomes to the level of individual genes, genetic testing in a broader sense includes biochemical tests for the possible presence of genetic diseases, or mutant forms of genes associated with increased risk of developing genetic disorders. Genetic testing identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. Most of the time, testing is used to find changes that are associated with inherited disorders. The results of a genetic test can confirm or rule out a suspected genetic condition or help determine a person's chance of developing or passing on a genetic disorder. Several hundred genetic tests are currently in use, and more are being developed. Since genetic testing may open up ethical or psychological problems, genetic testing is often accompanied by genetic counseling.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnetocardiography	Magnetocardiography	Magnetocardiography (MCG) is a technique to measure the magnetic fields produced by electrical activity in the heart using extremely sensitive devices such as the Superconducting Quantum Interference Device. If the magnetic field is measured using a multichannel device, a map of the magnetic field is obtained over the chest; from such a map, using mathematical algorithms that take into account the conductivity structure of the torso, it is possible to locate the source of the activity. For example, sources of abnormal rhythms or arrhythmia, may be located using MCG.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rectal_thermometry	Rectal thermometry	Rectal thermometry is an umbrella term covering the practice, widely used in modern medicine and science, of taking a mammal's temperature by inserting a thermometer into the aforementioned mammal's rectum via the anus. This is generally regarded as the most accurate means of temperature-taking, but some may consider it to be an invasive or humiliating procedure. Thus, it is often used sparingly and primarily on infants, children or adults for whom taking an oral temperature would risk injury (e.g. an unconscious patient, a post-oral surgery patient, or a person suffering a seizure) or be inaccurate (due to recently ingested liquids or breathing through the mouth).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oncotype_DX	Oncotype DX	Oncotype DX, developed by Genomic Health, is a diagnostic test that quantifies the likelihood of disease recurrence in women with early-stage hormone estrogen receptor (ER) positive only breast cancer (prognostic significance) and assesses the likely benefit from certain types of chemotherapy (predictive significance). Oncotype DX analyzes a panel of 21 genes within a tumor to determine a Recurrence Score. The Recurrence Score is a number between 0 and 100 that corresponds to a specific likelihood of breast cancer recurrence within 10 years of the initial diagnosis, though the score is not validated, though the buckets of Low, Intermediate or High Risk are when the patient receives / abides to 5 years of Tamoxifen. With this information, it may be possible for doctors and patients to make more informed decisions about breast cancer treatment options. Oncotype DX is performed by Genomic Health in its CLIA-certified, CAP-accredited reference laboratory. Oncotype DX was initially developed for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer with ER+ cancers whose lymph nodes do not contain tumor (node-negative). Typically in these cases, treatment with anti-hormonal therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, is planned, and the test can help define whether chemotherapy should or should not be added to that anti-hormone treatment. Oncotype DX remains unproven for use in patients with carcinoma in situ (precancerous) or distant metastatic breast cancer. However, in an analysis of tissue samples from a large clinical trial (SWOG 8814), Oncotype DX demonstrated both prognostic significance (the capability of predicting distant recurrence) and predictive significance (a second and different characteristic that describes the capability of the test to assess the potential benefit of additional adjuvant chemotherapy) in women with estrogen receptor positive early breast cancer whose lymph nodes show spread of their tumor (node-positive), and the test has also shown similar prognostic and predictive significance in women both either node negative or node positive early breast cancer who received adjuvant treatment with the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole. Moreover, small studies with tumor specimens from breast cancer patients receiving neoadjuvant treatment show similar results and suggest that the test may predict response to neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (oncology) and chemotherapy. Oncotype DX is a noninvasive test that is performed on a small amount of the tissue removed during the original surgery lumpectomy, mastectomy, or core biopsy, which means no additional invasive procedure is required. After the surgical procedure, the tissue sample is fixed in formalin and embedded in paraffin so it can be preserved for further diagnostic testing. To perform Oncotype DX, the pathologist will send several thin sections of the formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue sample to Genomic Health. Oncotype DX uses a highly reproducible laboratory process known as RT-PCR to determine the expression of the 21-gene panel. The Oncotype DX test results are then integrated with other laboratory test results to help doctors formulate a treatment plan based on the unique characteristics of the tumor. Since Oncotype DX became available in 2004, it has been used by over 10,000 physicians to help guide treatment for over 200,000 patients in 60+ countries.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sputum_culture	Sputum culture	"A sputum culture is a test to detect and identify bacteria or fungi that infect the lungs or breathing passages. Sputum is a thick fluid produced in the lungs and in the adjacent airways. A sample of sputum is placed in a sterile container and sent to the laboratory for testing. Sampling may be performed by sputum being expectorated (produced by coughing), induced (saline is sprayed in the lungs to induce sputum production), or taken via an endotracheal tube with a protected specimen brush (commonly used on patients on respirators) in an intensive care setting. For selected organisms such as Cytomegalovirus or ""Pneumocystis jiroveci"" in specific clinical settings (immunocompromised patients) a bronchoalveolar lavage might be taken by an experienced pneumologist. If no bacteria or fungi grow, the culture is negative. If organisms that can cause the infection grow, the culture is positive. The type of bacterium or fungus is identified by microscopy, colony morphology and biochemical tests of bacterial growth. If bacteria or fungi that can cause infection grow in the culture, other tests can determine which antimicrobial agent will most effectively treat the infection. This is called susceptibility or sensitivity testing. In a hospital setting, a sputum culture is most commonly ordered if a patient has a pneumonia. The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends that sputum cultures be done in pneumonia requiring hospitalization, while the American College of Chest Physicians does not. One reason for such a discrepancy is that normal, healthy lungs have bacteria, and sputum cultures collect both normal and pathogenic bacteria. However, pure cultures of common respiratory pathogens in the absence of upper respiratory flora combined with symptoms of respiratory distress provides strong evidence of the infectious agent, and its significance. Such pathogens include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae and the highly infectious M tuberculosis, which are transmitted by inhaling aerosols. For this reason, laboratory processing of sputum for respiratory pathogens are performed with the aid of a biological safety cabinet."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trinder_glucose_activity_test	Trinder glucose activity test	The Trinder glucose activity test is a diagnostic test used in medicine to determine the presence of glucose or glucose oxidase. The test employs the Trinder reagent, and is a colour change test resulting from the Trinder reaction. The Trinder reagent, named after P. Trinder of the Biochemistry Department of the Royal Infirmary in Sunderland (see the article listed in further reading), comprises an aminoantipyrine and phenol (p-hydroxybenzene). The Trinder reaction is the reaction between hydrogen peroxide and the phenol and aminoantipyrine to form a quinone, catalyzed by the presence of a peroxidase. The hydrogen peroxide is itself produced by an initial reaction where the glucose is oxidised in the presence of the glucose oxidase catalyst into H2O2 and gluconic acid. The quinone is red-violet in colour, with the intensity of the colour being in proportion to the glucose concentration. The colour is measured at 505Â nm, 510Â nm, or 540Â nm. Diagnostic kits containing the Trinder reagent are available, including one from Sigma. The Stanbio Single Reagent Glucose Method is based upon the Trinder technique.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hamster_zona-free_ovum_test	Hamster zona-free ovum test	The hamster zona-free ovum test (HZFO test), or hamster test is a method for diagnosing male infertility due to the inability of the sperm to penetrate the ova. This test has limited value for most people experiencing infertility. In this test, sperm are incubated with several hamster eggs. After seven to twenty hours, the number of sperm penetrations per egg is measured. The hamster eggs have had the zona pellucida, the outer membrane, removed- hence, zona-free. Having all eggs penetrated by multiple sperm is considered to be a positive sign for fertility. Results suggest that men whose sperm fail the hamster test are a third as fertile than those whose sperm pass. Donated sperm and intracytoplasmic sperm injection techniques are considered more strongly for those whose sperm fail this test. The human sperm does not fertilize the hamster eggs, which are unable to grow or develop. The practice is made licensable in the United Kingdom by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nano-tetherball_Sensor	Nano-tetherball Sensor	Nano-tetherball Sensor is one of newly discovered methods in detecting glucose in the human body. Nano-tetherball Sensor for Glucose has attracted attention of diabetic medical community due to its methods and high sensitivity in performance. The machineâ€™s name comes from the fact that its design is similar to a small cube-shaped tetherball. Nano machines have been in the biosensor industry for more than two decades, and they have performed a number of different beneficial roles for diabetic patients. Despite the many opto/electronic mechanisms on the market, from a physical and chemical point of view, the nanomachine optical fiber provides many advantages over the other types. These advantages include its remote in-situ or actual detection; its wavelength has the highest degree of selectivity, with high information competence and analysis with multi-channels of wide capacity for detecting reagents that are non-responsive in electrical structures. The cubes rely on the tetherball structure and involve manipulation of tiny amounts of lasers in micro-channel using Nano-tetherballs. The Nano-tetherball process has the potential of being the most reliable in the accumulation of information. Medical statements that emphasize how the machine compares with other digital data storage and retrieval processes, to determine exactly how effective the machine is with processing the data detected and how to use said data. The information collected will be helpful for the formulation of treatments which are more practical than other digital bio-optical machines provide.

The procedure serves in diagnosing diseases in relation to cervical vertebrae and the vertebral column as well as diagnosing movement disorders of the neck. The patient performs the necessary moves in a sitting position in order to avoid unconscious body movements affecting the investigation results. Additionally, the patient stretches his arms and positions his hands between his knees for the same reasons. The head movements, which are performed during the investigation and between which the head is relocated each time into the normal position, are the following. The patient stretches his head forwards. The patient turns his head to the right. The patient turns his head to the left. The patient lays his head into the neck and looks upwards. The patient bows his head forwards and looks downwards. These movements are continuously repeated within a period of one minute. The patient is assisted during the test by an examinor sitting in front of him. The test results are recorded and graphically evaluated by a computer, for example with the help of cranio-corpography.

Sample results are expressed as a normal oxidative index (NOI), which is the ratio of the fluorescence in stimulated cells to the fluorescence expressed in unstimulated cells. Normal Range > 73 NOI
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impedance%E2%80%93pH_monitoring	Impedanceâ€“pH monitoring	Impedanceâ€“pH monitoring is a technique used in the diagnosis of gastroesophageal reflux disease, by monitoring both impedance and pH. Patients with ongoing symptoms while on PPI therapy are commonly diagnosed with impedanceâ€“pH monitoring while continuing their medications. The impedanceâ€“pH monitoring diagnostic test determines the frequency of reflux episodes and the time relationship of reflux episodes and symptoms. The impedanceâ€“pH monitoring test determines if the patient's symptoms are related to acid reflux, related to nonacid reflux, or not related to reflux of any type. A positive GERD diagnosis is made if acid or nonacid reflux precedes symptoms in a statistically meaningful manner. Patients with a positive impedanceâ€“pH monitoring test may benefit from acid-reduction therapy such as fundoplication surgery or endoscopic fundoplication techniques.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Point-of-care_genetic_testing	Point-of-care genetic testing	Point-of-care genetic testing incorporates the newest most sophisticated techniques to identify variations in the genetic sequence at the bedside â€“ enabling clinicians to react and alter therapy based upon the results. Traditional genetic testing involves the analysis of DNA in order to detect genotypes related to a heritable disease or phenotype of interest for clinical purposes. However, current testing methods require days to weeks before results are available limiting the clinical applicability of genetic testing in a number of circumstances. Recently, the first point-of-care genetic test in medicine was demonstrated to be effective in identifying CYP2C19*2 carriers allowing tailoring of anti-platelet regimens to reduce high on treatment platelet reactivity. In the RAPID GENE study, Drs. Jason Roberts and Derek So from the University of Ottawa Heart Institute validated a pharmacogenomics approach in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention for acute coronary syndrome or stable coronary artery disease. This study is the first in medicine to incorporate point-of-care testing with genetics into routine clinical care and decision making.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannula_transfer	Cannula transfer	Cannula transfer or cannulation is a subset of air-free techniques used with a Schlenk line, in transferring liquid or solution samples between reaction vessels via cannulae, avoiding atmospheric contamination. While the syringes are not the same as cannulae, the techniques remain relevant. There are two methods of transfer: vacuum, and pressure. Both utilize differences in pressures between two vessels to push the fluid through. Often, the main difficulty encountered is slow transfer due to the high viscosity of the fluid.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ion-mobility_spectrometry%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry	Ion-mobility spectrometryâ€“mass spectrometry	Ion-mobility spectrometryâ€“mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is a method that is potentially able to rapidly separate components on a millisecond timescale using ion-mobility spectrometry and use mass spectrometry on a microsecond timescale to identify components within a test sample
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Suction_filtration	Suction filtration	Suction filtration is a chemistry laboratory technique which allows for a greater rate of filtration. Whereas in normal filtration gravity provides the force which draws the liquid through the filter paper, in suction filtration a pressure gradient performs this function. This has the advantage of offering a variable rate depending on the strength of the pump being used to extract air from the BÃ¼chner flask. Care must be taken not to use such a strong vacuum that the filter paper rips (in which case all the solid will be lost back into the solvent) or in extreme cases the glass flask breaks. Suction filtration is used in recrystallisation experiments.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Annexin_A5_affinity_assay	Annexin A5 affinity assay	In molecular biology, an annexin A5 affinity assay is a test to quantify the number of cells undergoing apoptosis. The assay uses the protein annexin A5 to tag apoptotic and dead cells and the numbers are then counted using either flow cytometry or a fluorescence microscope. The annexin a5 protein binds to apoptotic cells in a calcium dependent manner using phosphatidylserine containing membrane surfaces which are usually only present on the inner leaflet of the membrane.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electric_cell-substrate_impedance_sensing	Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing	Electric cell-substrate impedance sensing or ECIS (a trademark of Applied BioPhysics Inc. ) refers to a non-invasive biophysical approach to monitor living animal cells in vitro, i.e. within a well-defined laboratory environment. In ECIS the cells are grown on the surface of small and planar gold-film electrodes, which are deposited on the bottom of a cell culture dish. The AC impedance of the cell-covered electrode is then measured at one or several frequencies as a function of time. Due to the insulating properties of their membranes the cells behave like dielectric particles so that the impedance increases with increasing coverage of the electrode until a confluent (i.e. continuous) layer of cells is established. In confluent cell layers the measured impedance is mainly determined by the three-dimensional shape of the cells. If cell shape changes occur, the current pathways through and around the cell bodies change as well, leading to a corresponding increase or decrease of impedance. Thus, by recording time-resolved impedance measurements, cell shape changes can be followed in real time with sub-microscopic resolution and can be used for bioanalytic purposes. As the shape of animal cells responds very sensitively to alterations in metabolism as well as chemical, biological or physical stimuli, the ECIS technique is applied in various experimental settings in cell biological research laboratories. It can be used as a sensor in cytotoxicity studies, drug development or as a non-invasive means to follow cell adhesion to in vitro surfaces. Equipments based on the ECIS technique are also dedicated to monitor the chemokinetic activity of adherent cells spread on the electrode surface (micromotion) as well as their chemotactic activities in ECIS-based wound healing assays.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Air-free_technique	Air-free technique	"Air-free techniques refer to a range of manipulations in the chemistry laboratory for the handling of compounds that are air-sensitive. These techniques prevent the compounds from reacting with components of air, usually water and oxygen; less commonly carbon dioxide and nitrogen. A common theme among these techniques is the use of a high vacuum to remove air, and the use of an inert gas: preferably argon, but often nitrogen. The two most common types of air-free technique involve the use of a glovebox and a Schlenk line. In both methods, glassware are pre-dried in ovens prior to use. They may be flame-dried to remove adsorbed water. Prior to coming into an inert atmosphere, vessels are further dried by purge-and-refill â€” the vessel is subjected to a vacuum to remove gases and water, and then refilled with inert gas. This cycle is usually repeated three times or the vacuum is applied for an extended period of time. One of the differences between the use of a glovebox and a Schlenk line is where the purge-and-refill cycle is applied. When using a glovebox the purge-and-refill is applied to an airlock attached to the glovebox, commonly called the ""port"" or ""ante-chamber"". In contrast when using a Schlenk line the purge-and-refill is applied directly to the reaction vessel through a hose or ground glass joint that is connected to the manifold."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gas_chromatography%E2%80%93mass_spectrometry	Gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry	"Gas chromatographyâ€“mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is a method that combines the features of gas-liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry to identify different substances within a test sample. Applications of GC-MS include drug detection, fire investigation, environmental analysis, explosives investigation, and identification of unknown samples. GC-MS can also be used in airport security to detect substances in luggage or on human beings. Additionally, it can identify trace elements in materials that were previously thought to have disintegrated beyond identification. GC-MS has been widely heralded as a ""gold standard"" for forensic substance identification because it is used to perform a specific test. A specific test positively identifies the actual presence of a particular substance in a given sample. A non-specific test merely indicates that a substance falls into a category of substances. Although a non-specific test could statistically suggest the identity of the substance, this could lead to false positive identification."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vacuum_distillation	Vacuum distillation	Vacuum distillation is a method of distillation whereby the pressure above the liquid mixture to be distilled is reduced to less than its vapor pressure (usually less than atmospheric pressure) causing evaporation of the most volatile liquid(s) (those with the lowest boiling points). This distillation method works on the principle that boiling occurs when the vapor pressure of a liquid exceeds the ambient pressure. Vacuum distillation is used with or without heating the mixture.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laboratory_diagnosis_of_viral_infections	Laboratory diagnosis of viral infections	In the diagnostic laboratory virus infections are confirmed by several methods that include: Growth of the virus in a cell culture from a specimen taken from the patient. Detection of virus-specific antibodies in the blood. Detection of virus antigens Detection of virus nucleic acids Observation of virus particles by electron microscopy. Hemagglutination assay
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Plaque_reduction_neutralization_test	Plaque reduction neutralization test	"The Plaque reduction neutralization test is used to quantify the titre of neutralising antibody for a virus. The serum sample or solution of antibody to be tested is diluted and mixed with a viral suspension. This is incubated to allow the antibody to react with the virus. This is poured over a confluent monolayer of host cells. The surface of the cell layer is covered in a layer of agar or carboxymethyl cellulose to prevent the virus from spreading indiscriminately. The concentration of plaque forming units can be estimated by the number of plaques (regions of infected cells) formed after a few days. Depending on the virus, the plaque forming units are measured by microscopic observation, fluorescent antibodies or specific dyes that react with infected cells. The concentration of serum to reduce the number of plaques by 50% compared to the serum free virus gives the measure of how much antibody is present or how effective it is. This measurement is denoted as the PRNT50 value. Currently it is considered to be the ""gold standard"" for detecting and measuring antibodies that can neutralise the viruses that cause many diseases. It has a higher sensitivity than other tests like hemagglutination and many commercial Enzyme immunoassay without compromising specificity. However, the test is relatively cumbersome and time intensive (few days) relative to EIA kits that give quick results (usually several minutes to a few hours)."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kodevirion	Kodevirion	The term kodecyte is used to describe cells with detectable FSL constructs, and in concert, the term kodevirion (pronounced co-da-virion), is used to describe virions with detectable Function-Spacer-Lipid (FSL) constructs. The method for labeling virions with FSL constructs is simple, non covalent and only involves incubation of the virion with the FSL construct in saline for a few hours â€“ nothing further is required. The FSL construct will spontaneously, stably and quantitatively incorporate into the virion membrane. Virions have been labelled with fluorescent (FSL-FLRO4) and radioactive iodine (FSL-125I). FSL-FLRO4 could be shown to label virions in a dose dependent manner and could be visualized by flow cytometry either directly, or indirectly if the virion had bound to the cell or fused with the cell membrane. FSLs do not appear to significantly affect the virions infectivity or their ability to bind target cells, probably because they integrate into the membrane without exposing the virion to chemical agents or covalent modification.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Virus_quantification	Virus quantification	Virus quantification involves counting the number of viruses in a specific volume to determine the virus concentration. It is utilized in both research and development (R&D) in commercial and academic laboratories as well as production situations where the quantity of virus at various steps is an important variable. For example, the production of viral vaccines, recombinant proteins using viral vectors and viral antigens all require virus quantification to continually adapt and monitor the process in order to optimize production yields and respond to ever changing demands and applications. Examples of specific instances where known viruses need to be quantified include clone screening, multiplicity of infection (MOI) optimization and adaptation of methods to cell culture. This page discusses various techniques currently used to quantify viruses in liquid samples. These methods are separated into two categories, traditional vs. modern methods. Traditional methods are industry-standard methods that have been used for decades but are generally slow and labor intensive. Modern methods are relatively new commercially available products and kits that greatly reduce quantification time. This is not meant to be an exhaustive review of all potential methods, but rather a representative cross-section of traditional methods and new, commercially available methods. While other published methods may exist for virus quantification, non-commercial methods are not discussed here.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acid-base_extraction	Acid-base extraction	Acid-base extraction is a procedure using sequential liquidâ€“liquid extractions to purify acids and bases from mixtures based on their chemical properties. Acid-base extraction is routinely performed during the work-up after chemical syntheses and for the isolation of compounds and natural products like alkaloids from crude extracts. The product is largely free of neutral and acidic or basic impurities. It is not possible to separate chemically similar acids or bases using this simple method.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Affinity_electrophoresis	Affinity electrophoresis	"Affinity electrophoresis is a general name for many analytical methods used in biochemistry and biotechnology. Both qualitative and quantitative information may be obtained through affinity electrophoresis. The methods include the so-called mobility shift electrophoresis, charge shift electrophoresis and affinity capillary electrophoresis. The methods are based on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of molecules through biospecific interaction or complex formation. The interaction or binding of a molecule, charged or uncharged, will normally change the electrophoretic properties of a molecule. Membrane proteins may be identified by a shift in mobility induced by a charged detergent. Nucleic acids or nucleic acid fragments may be characterized by their affinity to other molecules. The methods has been used for estimation of binding constants, as for instance in lectin affinity electrophoresis or characterization of molecules with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. For enzymes and other ligand-binding proteins, onedimensional electrophoresis similar to counter electrophoresis or to ""rocket immunoelectrophoresis"", affinity electrophoresis may be used as an alternative quantification of the protein. Some of the methods are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ames_test	Ames test	The Ames test is a biological assay to assess the mutagenic potential of chemical compounds. A positive test indicates that the chemical is mutagenic and therefore may act as a carcinogen, since cancer is often linked to mutation. However, a number of false-positives and false-negatives are known. The test serves as a quick and convenient assay to estimate the carcinogenic potential of a compound since standard carcinogen assays on rodents are time-consuming (taking two to three years to complete) and expensive. The procedure is described in a series of papers from the early 1970s by Bruce Ames and his group at the University of California, Berkeley.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ammonium_sulfate_precipitation	Ammonium sulfate precipitation	Ammonium sulfate precipitation is a method used to purify proteins by altering their solubility. It is a specific case of a more general technique known as salting out. Ammonium sulfate is commonly used as its solubility is so high that salt solutions with high ionic strength are allowed. The solubility of proteins varies according to the ionic strength of the solution, and hence according to the salt concentration. Two distinct effects are observed: at low salt concentrations, the solubility of the protein increases with increasing salt concentration (i.e. increasing ionic strength), an effect termed salting in. As the salt concentration (ionic strength) is increased further, the solubility of the protein begins to decrease. At sufficiently high ionic strength, the protein will be almost completely precipitated from the solution (salting out). Since proteins differ markedly in their solubilities at high ionic strength, salting-out is a very useful procedure to assist in the purification of a given protein. The commonly used salt is ammonium sulfate, as it is very water soluble, forms two ions high in the Hofmeister series, and has no adverse effects upon enzyme activity. It is generally used as a saturated aqueous solution which is diluted to the required concentration, expressed as a percentage concentration of the saturated solution (a 100% solution). In the preliminary test, the ammonium sulfate concentration is increased stepwise, and the precipitated protein is recovered at each stage. This is usually done by adding solid ammonium sulfate, but calculating how much ammonium sulfate to add to a solution at one concentration to achieve a desired higher concentration is tricky, since addition of ammonium sulfate significantly increases the volume of the solution. The amount to add can be determined either from published nomograms or by using an online calculator http://www. encorbio. com/protocols/AM-SO4. htm. Each protein precipitate is dissolved individually in fresh buffer and assayed for total protein content and amount of desired protein. The aim is to find the ammonium sulfate concentration which will precipitate the maximum proportion of undesired protein, whilst leaving most of the desired protein still in solution or vice versa. The precipitated protein is then removed by centrifugation and then the ammonium sulfate concentration is increased to a value that will precipitate most of the protein of interest whilst leaving the maximum amount of protein contaminants still in solution. The precipitated protein of interest is recovered by centrifugation and dissolved in fresh buffer for the next stage of purification. This technique is useful to quickly remove large amounts of contaminant proteins, as a first step in many purification schemes. It is also often employed during the later stages of purification to concentrate protein from dilute solution following procedures such as gel filtration.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Animal_testing	Animal testing	Animal testing, also known as animal experimentation, animal research, and in vivo testing, is the use of non-human animals in experiments (although some research about animals involves only natural behaviors or pure observation, such as a mouse running a maze or field studies of chimp troops). Worldwide it is estimated that the number of vertebrate animalsâ€”from zebrafish to non-human primatesâ€”ranges from the tens of millions to more than 100 million used annually. Invertebrates, mice, rats, birds, fish, frogs, and animals not yet weaned are not included in the figures in the United States; one estimate of mice and rats used in the US alone in 2001 was 80 million. Most animals are euthanized after being used in an experiment. Sources of laboratory animals vary between countries and species; most animals are purpose-bred, while others are caught in the wild or supplied by dealers who obtain them from auctions and pounds. The research is conducted inside universities, medical schools, pharmaceutical companies, farms, defense establishments, and commercial facilities that provide animal-testing services to industry. It includes pure research such as genetics, developmental biology, behavioral studies, as well as applied research such as biomedical research, xenotransplantation, drug testing and toxicology tests, including cosmetics testing. Animals are also used for education, breeding, and defense research. The practice is regulated to various degrees in different countries. Supporters of the use of animals in experiments, such as the British Royal Society, argue that virtually every medical achievement in the 20th century relied on the use of animals in some way, with the Institute for Laboratory Animal Research of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences arguing that even sophisticated computers are unable to model interactions between molecules, cells, tissues, organs, organisms, and the environment, making animal research necessary in many areas. Animal rights, and some animal welfare, organizationsâ€”such as PETA and BUAVâ€”question the legitimacy of it, arguing that it is cruel, poor scientific practice, poorly regulated, that medical progress is being held back by misleading animal models, that some of the tests are outdated, that it cannot reliably predict effects in humans, that the costs outweigh the benefits, or that animals have an intrinsic right not to be used for experimentation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anterograde_tracing	Anterograde tracing	"In neuroscience, anterograde tracing is a research method which is used to trace axonal projections from their source to their point of termination. The complementary technique is retrograde tracing, which is used to trace neural connections from their termination to their source (i.e. synapse to cell body). Both the anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques are based on the visualization of the biological process of axonal transport. The anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques allow the detailed descriptions of neuronal projections from a single population of neurons to their various targets throughout the nervous system. These techniques allow the ""mapping"" of connections between neurons in a particular structure and the target neurons in the brain. Much of what is currently known about connectional neuroanatomy was discovered through the use of the anterograde and retrograde tracing techniques."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baby_Gender_Mentor	Baby Gender Mentor	Baby Gender Mentor is the trade name of a controversial blood test designed for prenatal sex discernment, that is, to determine whether a pregnant woman is carrying a male or female child. The test is made by Acu-Gen Biolab, Inc. , a biotech company in Lowell, Massachusetts, United States, and is marketed to detect the sex of a fetus as early as five weeks after conception. The test made a prominent media debut on 17 June 2005 on The Today Show and it was featured in Newsweek in October 2005. About 4,500 people had purchased the test by March 2006. The test and its competitors represent an alternative to medical procedures which determine the sex of the fetus, such as amniocentesis and ultrasound. One possible advantage of using blood tests for prenatal sex testing is the minimally invasive nature of this method. In contrast, there are small, demonstrated risks associated with amniocentesis, and some authorities believe that there could be theoretical risks associated with ultrasound. Women may have many motivations for using a test to learn the sex of their fetuses early in pregnancy, including mental preparation and planning gender-specific purchases, or more controversially, sex-selective abortion. The Baby Gender Mentor test is not regulated by the FDA, nor approved for diagnosis of any disease. According to the Baby Gender Mentor web site, the test involves using real-time polymerase chain reaction and a proprietary technology to detect markers on the Y-chromosome, which can be isolated from the pregnant woman's blood if the fetus is male. However, the company has kept details of the test proprietary, refusing to publish their data until they receive a patent. Customers and scientists have questioned the accuracy of the test, and legal action is being pursued against Acu-Gen as well as a major supplier of the test. The lawsuits claim that Acu-Gen's products are inaccurate with babies having their sex confirmed with ultrasounds and at birth. In their defense, Acu-Gen replied that ultrasounds were incorrect and that some of the babies had gender abnormalities.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blot_(biology)	Blot (biology)	A blot, in molecular biology and genetics, is a method of transferring proteins, DNA or RNA, onto a carrier. In many instances, this is done after a gel electrophoresis, transferring the molecules from the gel onto the blotting membrane, and other times adding the samples directly onto the membrane. After the blotting, the transferred proteins, DNA or RNA are then visualized by colorant staining (for example, silver staining of proteins), autoradiographic visualization of radioactive labelled molecules (performed before the blot), or specific labelling of some proteins or nucleic acids. The latter is done with antibodies or hybridization probes that bind only to some molecules of the blot and have an enzyme joined to them. After proper washing, this enzymatic activity (and so, the molecules we search in the blot) is visualized by incubation with proper reactive, rendering either a colored deposit on the blot or a chemiluminiscent reaction which is registered by photographic film.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/COLD-PCR	COLD-PCR	COLD-PCR (co-amplification at lower denaturation temperature-PCR) is a modified Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) protocol that enriches variant alleles from a mixture of wildtype and mutation-containing DNA. The ability to preferentially amplify and identify minority alleles and low-level somatic DNA mutations in the presence of excess wildtype alleles is useful for the detection of mutations. Detection of mutations is important in the case of early cancer detection from tissue biopsies and body fluids such as blood plasma or serum, assessment of residual disease after surgery or chemotherapy, disease staging and molecular profiling for prognosis or tailoring therapy to individual patients, and monitoring of therapy outcome and cancer remission or relapse. Common PCR will amplify both the major (wildtype) and minor (mutant) alleles with the same efficiency, occluding the ability to easily detect the presence of low-level mutations. The capacity to detect a mutation in a mixture of variant/wildtype DNA is valuable because this mixture of variant DNAs can occur when provided with a heterogeneous sample â€“ as is often the case with cancer biopsies. Currently, traditional PCR is used in tandem with a number of different downstream assays for genotyping or the detection of somatic mutations. These can include the use of amplified DNA for RFLP analysis, MALDI-TOF (matrix-assisted laser-desorptionâ€“time-of-flight) genotyping, or direct sequencing for detection of mutations by Sanger sequencing or pyrosequencing. Replacing traditional PCR with COLD-PCR for these downstream assays will increase the reliability in detecting mutations from mixed samples, including tumors and body fluids.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chemotaxis_assay	Chemotaxis assay	Chemotaxis assays are experimental tools for evaluation of chemotactic ability of prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. A wide variety of techniques are known and applied for such reason. Some of them qualitative and investigator can determine whether the cells prefer or not the tested chemical, others are quantitative and we can get information about the intensity of the responses in a more detailed way.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chromosome_jumping	Chromosome jumping	Chromosome jumping is a tool of molecular biology that is used in the physical mapping of genomes. It is related to several other tools used for the same purpose, including chromosome walking. Chromosome jumping is used to bypass regions difficult to clone, such as those containing repetitive DNA, that cannot be easily mapped by chromosome walking, and is useful in moving along a chromosome rapidly in search of a particular gene. In chromosome jumping, the DNA of interest is identified, cut into fragments with restriction enzymes, and circularised (the beginning and end of each fragment are joined together to form a circular loop). From a known sequence a primer is designed to sequence across the circularised junction. This primer is used to jump 100 kb-300 kb intervals: a sequence 100 kb away would have come near the known sequence on circularisation. Thus, sequences not reachable by chromosome walking can be sequenced. Chromosome walking can be used from the new jump position (in either direction) to look for gene-like sequences, or additional jumps can be used to progress further along the chromosome.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clearing_factor	Clearing factor	In centrifugation the clearing factor or k factor represents the relative pelleting efficiency of a given centrifuge rotor at maximum rotation speed. It can be used to estimate the time (in hours) required for sedimentation of a fraction with a known sedimentation coefficient : The value of the clearing factor depends on the maximum angular velocity of a centrifuge (in rad/s) and the minimum and maximum radius of the rotor: As the rotational speed of a centrifuge is usually specified in RPM, the following formula is often used for convenience: Centrifuge manufacturers usually specify the minimum, maximum and average radius of a rotor, as well as the factor of a centrifuge-rotor combination. For runs with a rotational speed lower than the maximum rotor-speed, the factor has to be adjusted: The K-factor is related to the sedimentation coefficient by the formula: Where is the time to pellet a certain particle in hours. Since is a constant for a certain particle, this relationship can be used to interconvert between different rotors. Where is the time to pellet in one rotor, and is the K-factor of that rotor. is the K-factor of the other rotor, and, the time to pellet in the other rotor, can be calculated. In this manner, one does not need access to the exact rotor cited in a protocol, as long as the K-factor can be calculated. Many online calculators are available to perform the calculations for common rotors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conditioned_place_preference	Conditioned place preference	Conditioned Place Preference (CPP) is a form of Pavlovian conditioning used to measure the motivational effects of objects or experiences. This paradigm can also be used to measure conditioned place aversion with an identical procedure involving aversive stimuli instead. Both procedures usually involve mice or rats as subjects. This procedure can be used to measure extinction and of the conditioned stimulus. Certain drugs are used in this paradigm to measure their reinforcing properties. Two different methods are used to choose the compartments to be conditioned, and these are biased vs. unbiased. The biased method allows the animal to explore the apparatus, and the compartment they least prefer is the one that the drug is administered in and the one they most prefer is the one where the vehicle is injected. This method allows the animal to choose the compartment they get the drug and vehicle in. In comparison, the unbiased method doesn't allow the animal to choose what compartment they get the drug and vehicle in and instead the researcher chooses the compartments.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cooling_bath	Cooling bath	In organic chemistry, a cooling bath is a liquid mixture which is used to maintain low temperatures, typically between 13 Â°C and -196 Â°C. These low temperatures are used to collect organic liquids after distillation, to remove solvents using a rotary evaporator, or to perform a chemical reaction below room temperature. The cooling agents used in these baths include dry ice, liquid nitrogen, and water ice.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cot_analysis	Cot analysis	C0t analysis, a technique based on the principles of DNA reassociation kinetics, is a biochemical technique that measures how much repetitive DNA is in a DNA sample such as a genome. It is used to study genome structure and organization and has also been used to simplify the sequencing of genomes that contain large amounts of repetitive sequence.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cot_filtration	Cot filtration	"Cot filtration, or CF, is a technique that uses the principles of DNA renaturation kinetics to separate the repetitive DNA sequences that dominate many eukaryotic genomes from ""gene-rich"" single/low-copy sequences.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cycling_probe_technology	Cycling probe technology	"Cycling probe technology (CPT) is a molecular biological technique for detecting specific DNA sequences. CPT operates under isothermal conditions. In some applications, CPT offers an alternative to PCR. However, unlike PCR, CPT does not generate multiple copies of the target DNA itself, and the amplification of the signal is linear, in contrast to the geometric amplification of the target DNA in PCR Tang et al. (as cited in ""References"") developed an integrated electrokinetic system for use in CPT."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA_extraction	DNA extraction	DNA isolation is a routine procedure to collect DNA for subsequent molecular or forensic analysis. There are three basic and two optional steps in a DNA extraction: Breaking the cells open, commonly referred to as cell disruption or cell lysis, to expose the DNA within. This is commonly achieved by chemical and physical methods-blending, grinding or sonicating the sample. Removing membrane lipids by adding a detergent or surfactants. Removing proteins by adding a protease (optional but almost always done). Removing RNA by adding an RNase (often done). Precipitating the DNA with an alcohol â€” usually ice-cold ethanol or isopropanol. Since DNA is insoluble in these alcohols, it will aggregate together, giving a pellet upon centrifugation. This step also removes alcohol-soluble salt. See ethanol precipitation. Refinements of the technique include adding a chelating agent to sequester divalent cations such as Mg and Ca, which prevents enzymes like DNase from degrading the DNA. Cellular and histone proteins bound to the DNA can be removed either by adding a protease or by having precipitated the proteins with sodium or ammonium acetate, or extracted them with a phenol-chloroform mixture prior to the DNA-precipitation. If desired, the DNA can be resolubilized in a slightly alkaline buffer or in ultra-pure water.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA_footprinting	DNA footprinting	DNA footprinting is a method of investigating the sequence specificity of DNA-binding proteins in vitro. This technique can be used to study protein-DNA interactions both outside and within cells. The regulation of transcription has been studied extensively, and yet there is still much that is not known. Transcription factors and associated proteins that bind promoters, enhancers, or silencers to drive or repress transcription are fundamental to understanding the unique regulation of individual genes within the genome. Techniques like DNA footprinting will help elucidate which proteins bind to these regions of DNA and unravel the complexities of transcriptional control.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNA_laddering	DNA laddering	"DNA laddering is a feature that can be observed when DNA fragments resulting from apoptotic DNA fragmentation are visualised after separation by gel electrophoresis. It was first described in 1980 by Andrew Wyllie at the University of Edinburgh Medical School. DNA laddering is a distinctive feature of DNA degraded by caspase-activated DNase (CAD), which is a key event during apoptosis. CAD cleaves genomic DNA at internucleosomal linker regions, resulting in DNA fragments that are multiples of 180â€“185 base-pairs in length. Separation of the fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis and subsequent visualisation, for example by ethidium bromide staining, results in a characteristic ""ladder"" pattern. While most of the morphological features of apoptotic cells are short-lived, DNA laddering can be used as final state read-out method and has therefore become a reliable method to distinguish apoptosis from necrosis."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/DNase_footprinting_assay	DNase footprinting assay	"A DNase footprinting assay is a DNA footprinting technique from molecular biology/biochemistry that detects DNA-protein interaction using the fact that a protein bound to DNA will often protect that DNA from enzymatic cleavage. This makes it possible to locate a protein binding site on a particular DNA molecule. The method uses an enzyme, deoxyribonuclease (DNase, for short), to cut the radioactively end-labeled DNA, followed by gel electrophoresis to detect the resulting cleavage pattern. For example, the DNA fragment of interest may be PCR amplified using a P 5' labeled primer, with the result being many DNA molecules with a radioactive label on one end of one strand of each double stranded molecule. Cleavage by DNase will produce fragments, the smaller of which will move further on the electrophoretic gel. The fragments which are smaller with respect to the P-labelled end will appear further on the gel than the longer fragments. The gel is then used to expose a special photographic film. The cleavage pattern of the DNA in the absence of a DNA binding protein, typically referred to as free DNA, is compared to the cleavage pattern of DNA in the presence of a DNA binding protein. If the protein binds DNA, the binding site is protected from enzymatic cleavage. This protection will result in a clear area on the gel which is referred to as the ""footprint"". By varying the concentration of the DNA-binding protein, the binding affinity of the protein can be estimated according to the minimum concentration of protein at which a footprint is observed. This technique was developed by David Galas and Albert Schmitz at Geneva in 1977"
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Degasification	Degasification	Degasification is the removal of dissolved gases from liquids, especially water or aqueous solutions. There are numerous possible methods for such removal of gases from solids. Gases are removed for various reasons. Chemists remove gases from solvents when the compounds they are working on are possibly air- or oxygen-sensitive, or when bubble formation at solid-liquid interfaces becomes a problem. The formation of gas bubbles when a liquid is frozen can also be undesirable, necessitating degassing.

For other uses see Deposition 50x40pxThis article does not cite any references or sources. Please help improve this article by adding citations to reliable sources. Unsourced material may be challenged and removed. In chemistry, deposition is when the sediments settle down in a different place on the ground. The term is also widely used in earth science to describe the same process in a geological sense. Deposition of particles is an aggradational process â€” one that builds a landform â€” as opposed to a degradational process that erodes or reduces the size of a landform. For example, a river mouth delta is formed by deposition of sediment carried by the stream as the river current diminishes upon encountering the sea. Deposition can be viewed as a process reverse to sublimation, dissolution, or particle re-entrainment.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Digital_polymerase_chain_reaction	Digital polymerase chain reaction	"Digital polymerase chain reaction (digital PCR, DigitalPCR, dPCR, or dePCR) is a refinement of conventional polymerase chain reaction methods that can be used to directly quantify and clonally amplify nucleic acids including DNA, cDNA or RNA. The key difference between dPCR and traditional PCR lies in the method of measuring nucleic acids amounts, with the former being a more precise method than PCR. PCR carries out one reaction per single sample. dPCR also carries out a single reaction within a sample, however the sample is separated into a large number of partitions and the reaction is carried out in each partition individually. This separation allows a more reliable collection and sensitive measurement of nucleic acid amounts. The method has been demonstrated as useful for studying variations in gene sequences â€” such as copy number variants and point mutations â€” and it is routinely used for clonal amplification of samples for ""next-generation sequencing."""
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Direct_fluorescent_antibody	Direct fluorescent antibody	"A direct fluorescent antibody (DFA or dFA) (also known as ""Direct immunofluorescence"") is an antibody that has been tagged in a direct fluorescent antibody test. Its name derives from the fact that it directly tests the presence of an antigen with the tagged antibody, unlike western blotting, which uses an indirect method of detection, where the primary antibody binds the target antigen, with a secondary antibody directed against the primary, and a tag attached to the secondary antibody. Commercial DFA testing kits are available, which contain fluorescently labelled antibodies, designed to specifically target unique antigens present in the bacteria or virus, but not present in mammals. This technique can be used to quickly determine if a subject has a specific viral or bacterial infection. In the case of respiratory viruses, many of which have similar broad symptoms, detection can be carried out using nasal wash samples from the subject with the suspected infection. Although shedding cells in the respiratory tract can be obtained, it is often in low numbers, and so an alternative method can be adopted where compatible cell culture can be exposed to infected nasal wash samples, so if the virus is present it can be grown up to a larger quantity, which can then give a clearer positive or negative reading. As with all types of fluorescence microscopy, the correct absorption wavelength needs to be determined in order to excite the fluorophore tag attached to the antibody, and detect the fluorescence given off, which indicates which cells are positive for the presence of the virus or bacteria being detected. Direct fluorescent antibody can also be used to detect parasitic infections, as was pioneered by Sadun, et al. (1960)."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dispersion_stability	Dispersion stability	Dispersions are unstable from the thermodynamic point of view, however, they can be kinetically stable over a large period of time, which determines their shelf life. This time span needs to be measured in order to ensure the best product quality to the final consumer. â€œDispersion stability refers to the ability of a dispersion to resist change in its properties over time. â€ﾝ D.J. McClements.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electrochromatography	Electrochromatography	Electrochromatography is a chemical separation technique in analytical chemistry, biochemistry and molecular biology used to resolve and separate mostly large biomolecules such as proteins. It is a combination of size exclusion chromatography (gel filtration chromatography) and gel electrophoresis. These separation mechanisms operate essentially in superposition along the length of a gel filtration column to which an axial electric field gradient has been added. The molecules are separated by size due to the gel filtration mechanism and by electrophoretic mobility due to the gel electrophoresis mechanism. Additionally there are secondary chromatographic solute retention mechanisms.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electropherogram	Electropherogram	An electropherogram is a plot of results from an analysis done by electrophoresis automatic sequencing. Electropherograms may be used for deriving results from: genealogical DNA testing paternity testing DNA sequencing Genetic fingerprinting An electropherogram shows a sequence of data that is produced by an automated DNA sequencing machine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Electrophoretic_mobility_shift_assay	Electrophoretic mobility shift assay	An electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) or mobility shift electrophoresis, also referred as a gel shift assay, gel mobility shift assay, band shift assay, or gel retardation assay, is a common affinity electrophoresis technique used to study proteinâ€“DNA or proteinâ€“RNA interactions. This procedure can determine if a protein or mixture of proteins is capable of binding to a given DNA or RNA sequence, and can sometimes indicate if more than one protein molecule is involved in the binding complex. Gel shift assays are often performed in vitro concurrently with DNase footprinting, primer extension, and promoter-probe experiments when studying transcription initiation, DNA replication, DNA repair or RNA processing and maturation. Although precursors can be found in earlier literature, most current assays are based on methods described by Garner and Revzin and Fried and Crothers.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethanol_precipitation	Ethanol precipitation	Ethanol precipitation is a method used to purify and/or concentrate RNA, DNA and polysaccharides such as pectin and xyloglucan from aqueous solutions by adding ethanol as an antisolvent.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethidium_homodimer_assay	Ethidium homodimer assay	An ethidium homodimer assay can be used to detect dead or dying cells. Ethidium homodimer is a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye which binds to DNA. After a cell sample has been stained with ethidium homodimer, the dead cells may be viewed and counted under a UV-light microscope. When cells die, the plasma membranes of those cells becomes disrupted. Because of this, ethidium homodimer may enter those cells and bind to DNA within those cells. Because live cells don't have a compromised membrane, the ethidium homodimer can't enter. One reason for doing an ethidium homodimer assay instead of using a TUNEL assay to measure cell death is that ethidium homodimer stains all of the dead or dying cells, while TUNEL only stains cells that have undergone programmed cell death.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/F%C3%B6rster_resonance_energy_transfer	FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer	FÃ¶rster resonance energy transfer (FRET), Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET), resonance energy transfer (RET) or electronic energy transfer (EET), is a mechanism describing energy transfer between two chromophores. A donor chromophore, initially in its electronic excited state, may transfer energy to an acceptor chromophore through nonradiative dipoleâ€“dipole coupling. The efficiency of this energy transfer is inversely proportional to the sixth power of the distance between donor and acceptor making FRET extremely sensitive to small distances. Measurements of FRET efficiency can be used to determine if two fluorophores are within a certain distance of each other. Such measurements are used as a research tool in fields including biology and chemistry. FRET is analogous to near field communication, in that the radius of interaction is much smaller than the wavelength of light emitted. In the near field region, the excited chromophore emits a virtual photon that is instantly absorbed by a receiving chromophore. These virtual photons are undetectable, since their existence violates the conservation of energy and momentum, and hence FRET is known as a radiationless mechanism. Quantum electrodynamical calculations have been used to determine that radiationless (FRET) and radiative energy transfer are the short- and long-range asymptotes of a single unified mechanism.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/FLAG-tag	FLAG-tag	FLAG-tag, or FLAG octapeptide, is a polypeptide protein tag that can be added to a protein using recombinant DNA technology. It can be used for affinity chromatography, then used to separate recombinant, overexpressed protein from wild-type protein expressed by the host organism. It can also be used in the isolation of protein complexes with multiple subunits. A FLAG-tag can be used in many different assays that require recognition by an antibody. If there is no antibody against the studied protein, adding a FLAG-tag to this protein allows one to follow the protein with an antibody against the FLAG sequence. Examples are cellular localization studies by immunofluorescence or detection by SDS PAGE protein electrophoresis. The peptide sequence of the FLAG-tag from the N-terminus to the C-terminus is: DYKDDDDK (1012 Da). It can be used in conjunction with other affinity tags, for example a polyhistidine tag, HA-tag or myc-tag. It can be fused to the C-terminus or the N-terminus of a protein. Some commercially available antibodies (e.g. , M1/4E11) recognize the epitope only when it is present at the N-terminus. However, other available antibodies (e.g. , M2) are position-insensitive. The FLAG-tag was the first example of a fully functional epitope tag to be published in the scientific literature and, being the first, was the only epitope tag to be patented. Unlike some other tags (e.g. myc, HA), where a monoclonal was first isolated against an existing protein, then the epitope was characterized and used as a tag, the FLAG epitope was designed first, and then monoclonals were raised to recognize it. The FLAG tag's structure has been optimized for compatibility with the proteins it is attached to, in that it is more hydrophilic than other common epitope tags and therefore less likely to denature or inactivate proteins to which it is appended. In addition, N-terminal FLAG tags can be removed readily from proteins once they have been isolated, by treatment with the specific protease, enterokinase. The first published report of another epitope tagging method appeared about one year after the Flag system had been sent to laboratories throughout the world for beta-testing as a kit for recombinant protein production.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Far-Eastern_blotting	Far-Eastern blotting	Far-Eastern blotting is a technique developed in 1994 by Taki and colleagues at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University, Japan for the analysis of lipids separated by high-performance thin layer chromatography. The lipids are transferred from the HPTLC plate to a PVDF membrane for further analysis, for example by enzymatic or ligand binding assays or mass spectrometry. Cholesterol, glycerophospholipids and sphingolipids are major constituents of the cell membrane and in certain cases function as second messengers in cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell adhesion in inflammation and tumor metastasis. Far-eastern blotting was established as a method for transferring lipids from an HPTLC plate to a polyvinyledene difluoride membrane within a minute. Applications of this with other methods have been studied. Far-eastern blotting allows for the following techniques: Purification of glycosphingolipids and phospholipids. Structural analysis of lipids in conjunction with direct mass spectrometry. Binding study using various ligands such as antibodies, lectins, bacterium, viruses, and toxins, and Enzyme reaction on membranes. Not only analysis of lipids but also metabolites of drugs and natural compounds from plants, and environmental hormones are possible by this method.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Field_flow_fractionation	Field flow fractionation	"Field-flow fractionation, abbreviated FFF, is a separation technique where a field is applied to a fluid suspension or solution pumped through a long and narrow channel, perpendicular to the direction of flow, in order to cause separation of the particles present in the fluid, dependent on their differing ""mobilities"" under the force exerted by the field. It was invented and first reported by J. Calvin Giddings. The method of FFF is unique to other separation techniques due to the fact that it can separate materials over a wide colloidal size range while maintaining high resolution. Although FFF is an extremely versatile technique, there is no ""one size fits all"" method for all applications. In field-flow fractionation the field can be electrical, transverse flow through a semi-permeable membrane, gravitational, centrifugal, magnetic, thermal-gradient, etc. In all cases, the separation mechanism is born from differences in particle mobility (electrophoretic, when the field is a DC electric field causing a transverse electrical current flow) under the forces of the field, in equilibrium with the forces of diffusion: an often-parabolic laminar-flow-velocity profile in the channel determines the velocity of a particular particle, based on its equilibrium position from the wall of the channel. The ratio of the velocity of a species of particle to the average velocity of the fluid is called the retention ratio."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flow_cytometry	Flow cytometry	Flow cytometry is a laser based, biophysical technology employed in cell counting, sorting, biomarker detection and protein engineering, by suspending cells in a stream of fluid and passing them by an electronic detection apparatus. It allows simultaneous multiparametric analysis of the physical and/or chemical characteristics of up to thousands of particles per second. Flow cytometry is routinely used in the diagnosis of health disorders, especially blood cancers, but has many other applications in basic research, clinical practice and clinical trials. A common variation is to physically sort particles based on their properties, so as to purify populations of interest.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fosmid	Fosmid	Fosmids are similar to cosmids but are based on the bacterial F-plasmid. The cloning vector is limited, as a host can only contain one fosmid molecule. Fosmids can hold DNA inserts of up to 40 kb in size; often the source of the insert is random genomic DNA. A fosmid library is prepared by extracting the genomic DNA from the target organism and cloning it into the fosmid vector. The ligation mix is then packaged into phage particles and the DNA is transfected into the bacterial host. Bacterial clones propagate the fosmid library. The low copy number offers higher stability than vectors with relatively higher copy numbers, including cosmids. Fosmids may be useful for constructing stable libraries from complex genomes. Fosmids have high structural stability and have been found to maintain human DNA effectively even after 100 generations of bacterial growth. Fosmid clones were used to help assess the accuracy of the Public Human Genome Sequence.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gas_chromatography	Gas chromatography	"Gas chromatography (GC), is a common type of chromatography used in analytical chemistry for separating and analyzing compounds that can be vaporized without decomposition. Typical uses of GC include testing the purity of a particular substance, or separating the different components of a mixture (the relative amounts of such components can also be determined). In some situations, GC may help in identifying a compound. In preparative chromatography, GC can be used to prepare pure compounds from a mixture. In gas chromatography, the mobile phase (or ""moving phase"") is a carrier gas, usually an inert gas such as helium or an unreactive gas such as nitrogen. The stationary phase is a microscopic layer of liquid or polymer on an inert solid support, inside a piece of glass or metal tubing called a column (a homage to the fractionating column used in distillation). The instrument used to perform gas chromatography is called a gas chromatograph (or ""aerograph"", ""gas separator""). The gaseous compounds being analyzed interact with the walls of the column, which is coated with a stationary phase. This causes each compound to elute at a different time, known as the retention time of the compound. The comparison of retention times is what gives GC its analytical usefulness. Gas chromatography is in principle similar to column chromatography (as well as other forms of chromatography, such as HPLC, TLC), but has several notable differences. Firstly, the process of separating the compounds in a mixture is carried out between a liquid stationary phase and a gas mobile phase, whereas in column chromatography the stationary phase is a solid and the mobile phase is a liquid. (Hence the full name of the procedure is ""Gasâ€“liquid chromatography"", referring to the mobile and stationary phases, respectively. ) Secondly, the column through which the gas phase passes is located in an oven where the temperature of the gas can be controlled, whereas column chromatography (typically) has no such temperature control. Thirdly, the concentration of a compound in the gas phase is solely a function of the vapor pressure of the gas. Gas chromatography is also similar to fractional distillation, since both processes separate the components of a mixture primarily based on boiling point (or vapor pressure) differences. However, fractional distillation is typically used to separate components of a mixture on a large scale, whereas GC can be used on a much smaller scale (i.e. microscale). Gas chromatography is also sometimes known as vapor-phase chromatography (VPC), or gasâ€“liquid partition chromatography (GLPC). These alternative names, as well as their respective abbreviations, are frequently used in scientific literature. Strictly speaking, GLPC is the most correct terminology, and is thus preferred by many authors."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gel_electrophoresis	Gel electrophoresis	Gel electrophoresis is a method for separation and analysis of macromolecules and their fragments, based on their size and charge. It is used in clinical chemistry to separate proteins by charge and/or size (IEF agarose, essentially size independent) and in biochemistry and molecular biology to separate a mixed population of DNA and RNA fragments by length, to estimate the size of DNA and RNA fragments or to separate proteins by charge. Nucleic acid molecules are separated by applying an electric field to move the negatively charged molecules through an agarose matrix. Shorter molecules move faster and migrate farther than longer ones because shorter molecules migrate more easily through the pores of the gel. This phenomenon is called sieving. Proteins are separated by charge in agarose because the pores of the gel are too large to sieve proteins. Gel electrophoresis can also be used for separation of nanoparticles. Gel electrophoresis uses a gel as an anticonvective medium and/or sieving medium during electrophoresis, the movement of a charged particle in an electrical field. Gels suppress the thermal convection caused by application of the electric field, and can also act as a sieving medium, retarding the passage of molecules; gels can also simply serve to maintain the finished separation, so that a post electrophoresis stain can be applied. DNA Gel electrophoresis is usually performed for analytical purposes, often after amplification of DNA via PCR, but may be used as a preparative technique prior to use of other methods such as mass spectrometry, RFLP, PCR, cloning, DNA sequencing, or Southern blotting for further characterization.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gel_extraction	Gel extraction	In molecular biology, gel extraction or gel isolation is a technique used to isolate a desired fragment of intact DNA from an agarose gel following agarose gel electrophoresis. After extraction, fragments of interest can be mixed, precipitated, and enzymatically ligated together in several simple steps. This process, usually performed on plasmids, is the basis for rudimentary genetic engineering. After DNA samples are run on an agarose gel, extraction involves four basic steps: identifying the fragments of interest, isolating the corresponding bands, isolating the DNA from those bands, and removing the accompanying salts and stain. To begin, UV light is shone on the gel in order to illuminate all the ethidium bromide-stained DNA. Care must be taken to avoid exposing the DNA to mutagenic radiation for longer than absolutely necessary. The desired band is identified and physically removed with a cover slip or razor blade. The removed slice of gel should contain the desired DNA inside. An alternative method, utilizing SYBR Safe DNA gel stain and blue-light illumination, avoids the DNA damage associated with ethidium bromide and UV light. Several strategies for isolating and cleaning the DNA fragment of interest exist.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_gun	Gene gun	A gene gun or a biolistic particle delivery system, originally designed for plant transformation, is a device for injecting cells with genetic information. The payload is an elemental particle of a heavy metal coated with plasmid DNA. This technique is often simply referred to as bioballistics or biolistics. This device is able to transform almost any type of cell, including plants, and is not limited to genetic material of the nucleus: it can also transform organelles, including plastids.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_knockin	Gene knockin	"In molecular cloning and biology, a Knock-in (or Gene knock-in) refers to a genetic engineering method that involves the insertion of a protein coding cDNA sequence at a particular locus in an organism's chromosome. Typically, this is done in mice since the technology for this process is more refined, and because mouse embryonic stem cells are easily manipulated. The difference between knock-in technology and transgenic technology is that a knock-in involves a gene inserted into a specific locus, and is a ""targeted"" insertion. A common use of knock-in technology is for the creation of disease models. It is a technique by which scientific investigators may study the function of the regulatory machinery that governs the expression of the natural gene being replaced. This is accomplished by observing the new phenotype of the organism in question. The BACs and YACs are used in this case so that large fragments can be transferred."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gene_knockout	Gene knockout	"A gene knockout is a genetic technique in which one of an organism's genes is made inoperative (""knocked out"" of the organism). Also known as knockout organisms or simply knockouts, they are used in learning about a gene that has been sequenced, but which has an unknown or incompletely known function. Researchers draw inferences from the difference between the knockout organism and normal individuals. The term also refers to the process of creating such an organism, as in ""knocking out"" a gene. The technique is essentially the opposite of a gene knockin. Knocking out two genes simultaneously in an organism is known as a double knockout (DKO). Similarly the terms triple knockout (TKO) and quadruple knockouts (QKO) are used to describe three or four knocked out genes, respectively."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Host-Cell_Reactivation	Host-Cell Reactivation	The Host-Cell Reactivation Assay or HCR is a technique used to measure the repair capacity of cell of a particular DNA alteration. The host cell is transfected with a damaged plasmid containing a reporter gene, usually luciferase, which has been deactivated due to the damage. The ability of the cell to repair the damage in the plasmid after it is introduced to the cell allows the reporter gene to be reactivated leading it to produce its reporting product.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydrophilic_interaction_chromatography	Hydrophilic interaction chromatography	Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (or hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography, HILIC) is a version of partition chromatography which occupies the opposite end of the partition spectrum from reversed phase liquid chromatography. Both are distinct from normal phase liquid chromatography in that water is part of the mobile phase, and thus not adsorption chromatography. The name was suggested by Dr. Andrew Alpert in his 1990 paper on the subject. He described the chromatographic mechanism for it as liquid-liquid partition chromatography where analytes elute in order of increasing polarity, a conclusion supported by a review and re-evaluation of published data.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunocytochemistry	Immunocytochemistry	Immunocytochemistry (ICC) is a common laboratory technique that uses antibodies that target specific peptides or protein antigens in the cell via specific epitopes. These bound antibodies can then be detected using several different methods. ICC allows researchers to evaluate whether or not cells in a particular sample express the antigen in question. In cases where an immunopositive signal is found, ICC also allows researchers to determine which sub-cellular compartments are expressing the antigen.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunoperoxidase	Immunoperoxidase	Immunoperoxidase is a type of immunostain used in molecular biology, medical research, and clinical diagnostics. In particular, immunoperoxidase reactions refer to a sub-class of immunohistochemical or immunocytochemical procedures in which the antibodies are visualized via a peroxidase-catalyzed reaction. Immunohistochemistry and immunocytochemistry are methods used to determine in which cells or parts of cells a particular protein or other macromolecule are located. These stains use antibodies to bind to specific antigens, usually of protein or glycoprotein origin. Since antibodies are normally invisible, special strategies must be employed to detect these bound antibodies. In an immunoperoxidase procedure, an enzyme known as a peroxidase is used to catalyze a chemical reaction to produce a coloured product. Simply, a very thin slice of tissue is fixed onto glass, incubated with antibody or a series of antibodies, the last of which is chemically linked to the peroxidase enzyme. After developing the stain by adding the chemical substrate, the distribution of the stain can be examined by microscopy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Impalefection	Impalefection	]]Impalefection is a method of gene delivery using nanomaterials, such as carbon nanofibers, carbon nanotubes, nanowires Ref.1. Needle-like nanostructures are synthesized perpendicular to the surface of a substrate. Plasmid DNA containing the gene, intended for intracellular delivery, is attached to the nanostructure surface. A chip with arrays of these needles is then pressed against cells or tissue. Cells that are impaled by nanostructures can express the delivered gene(s). As one of the types of transfection, the term is derived from two words - impalement and infection.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/In_situ_hybridization	In situ hybridization	In situ hybridization (ISH) is a type of hybridization that uses a labeled complementary DNA or RNA strand to localize a specific DNA or RNA sequence in a portion or section of tissue, or, if the tissue is small enough (e.g. plant seeds, Drosophila embryos), in the entire tissue (whole mount ISH), in cells and in circulating tumor cells (CTCs). This is distinct from immunohistochemistry, which usually localizes proteins in tissue sections. DNA ISH can be used to determine the structure of chromosomes. Fluorescent DNA ISH (FISH) can, for example, be used in medical diagnostics to assess chromosomal integrity. RNA ISH (RNA in situ hybridization) is used to measure and localize RNAs (mRNAs, lncRNAs and miRNAs) within tissue sections, cells, whole mounts, and circulating tumor cells (CTCs). In situ hybridization was invented by Joseph G. Gall.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inverse_polymerase_chain_reaction	Inverse polymerase chain reaction	"Inverse polymerase chain reaction (Inverse PCR) is a variant of the polymerase chain reaction that is used to amplify DNA with only one known sequence. One limitation of conventional PCR is that it requires primers complementary to both termini of the target DNA, but this method allows PCR to be carried out even if only one sequence is available from which primers may be designed. Inverse PCR is especially useful for the determination of insert locations. For example, various retroviruses and transposons randomly integrate into genomic DNA. To identify the sites where they have entered, the known, ""internal"" viral or transposon sequences can be used to design primers that will amplify a small portion of the flanking, ""external"" genomic DNA. The amplified product can then be sequenced and compared with DNA databases to locate the sequence which has been disrupted. The inverse PCR method involves a series of restriction digests and ligation, resulting in a looped fragment that can be primed for PCR from a single section of known sequence. Then, like other polymerase chain reaction processes, the DNA is amplified by the temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase: A target region with an internal section of known sequence and unknown flanking regions is identified Genomic DNA is digested into fragments of a few kilobases by a usually low-moderate frequency (6-8 base) cutting restriction enzyme. Under low DNA concentrations, self-ligation is induced to give a circular DNA product. PCR is carried out as usual, with primers complementary to sections of the known internal sequence. * Finally the sequence is compared with the sequence available in the data base. Note: although the figure suggests that the circularized ligation product is digested prior to PCR, this is not the case. PCR does not require linear products and the use of another restriction enzyme to cut the known sequence could also cut within the unknown region, resulting in a failed PCR."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isotopic_dilution	Isotopic dilution	Isotope dilution analysis is a technique to increase the precision and accuracy of chemical analysis. First, a known amount of an isotope is added to the sample. For example, to determine the amount of lead in a sample, a known amount of Pb-204, one of the isotopes of lead, can be added. The natural abundance of lead isotopes is 204 (1.8%), 206 (22.1%), 207 (24.2%), and 208 (52.1%). The isotopic composition of the sample will be slightly changed. Then, by measuring each isotope, the amount of lead in the original sample can be calculated. In a typical gas chromatography analysis, isotopic dilution can decrease the error of injection from 5% to 1%. It can also be used in mass spectrometry (commonly referred to as isotopic dilution mass spectrometry or IDMS), in which the isotopic ratio can be determined with precision typically better than 0.25%. A slightly different form of isotopic dilution can be used for determining the composition of a radioactive sample. An additional amount of the radioactive isotope in the sample is added and the change in radioactivity is measured. The amount of the isotope in the original sample can then be calculated. To determine the concentration x g (unknown) substance, y g of radioactive substance is added with Si as the initial activity. After homogenization, small sample of the substance has to monitor for the activity. By law of conservation of activity, the mixture (x + y) with show the specific conserved activity Sf (final activity). Therefore, y * Si = (x + y) * Sf now, x = y * (Si - Sf)/Sf thus, the concentration or quantity of the unknown substance can be calculated using the above equation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isotopic_labeling	Isotopic labeling	Isotopic labeling (or isotopic labelling) is a technique used to track the passage of an isotope, or an atom with a variation, through a reaction, metabolic pathway, or cell. The reactant is 'labeled' by replacing specific atoms by their isotope. The reactant is then allowed to undergo the reaction. The position of the isotopes in the products is measured to determine the sequence the isotopic atom followed in the reaction or the cell's metabolic pathway. In isotopic labeling, there are multiple ways to detect the presence of labeling isotopes; through their mass, vibrational mode, or radioactive decay. Mass spectrometry or nuclear magnetic resonance detects the difference in an isotope's mass, while Infrared spectroscopy detects the difference in the isotope's vibrational modes. The radioactive decay can be detected through an ionization chamber or autoradiographs of gels. An example of the use of isotopic labeling is the study of phenol (C6H5OH) in water by replacing common hydrogen with deuterium (deuterium labeling). Upon adding phenol to deuterated water (water containing D2O in addition to the usual H2O), the substitution of deuterium for the hydrogen is observed in phenol's hydroxyl group (resulting in C6H5OD), indicating that phenol readily undergoes hydrogen-exchange reactions with water. Only the hydroxyl group was affected, indicating that the other 5 hydrogen atoms did not participate in these exchange reactions.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Crystallization	Crystallization	Crystallization is the (natural or artificial) process of formation of solid crystals precipitating from a solution, melt or more rarely deposited directly from a gas. Crystallization is also a chemical solidâ€“liquid separation technique, in which mass transfer of a solute from the liquid solution to a pure solid crystalline phase occurs. In chemical engineering crystallization occurs in a crystallizer. Crystallization is therefore an aspect of precipitation, obtained through a variation of the solubility conditions of the solute in the solvent, as compared to precipitation due to chemical reaction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Decantation	Decantation	Decantation is a process for the separation of mixtures, by removing a top layer of liquid from which a precipitate has settled. Usually a small amount of solution must be left in the container, and care must be taken to prevent a small amount of precipitate from flowing with the solution out of the container. It is frequently used to purify a liquid by separating it from a suspension of insoluble particles (e.g. in red wine, where the wine is decanted from the potassium bitartrate crystals). For example, to obtain a sample of clear water from muddy water, muddy water is left in a container until the mud settles, and then the clear water is poured into another container. A mixture of two immiscible liquids can also be separated by decantation. For example, the oil and water extracted from fish may be decanted to obtain the oil. A mixture of kerosene and water can also be separated through decantation. A centrifuge may be useful in successfully decanting a solution. The centrifuge causes the precipitate to be forced to the bottom of the container; if the force is high enough, the precipitate may form a compact solid. Then the liquid can be more easily poured away, as the precipitate will likely remain in its compressed form. A mixture of an insoluble solid in liquid is allowed to stand. The solid is insoluble and settles at the bottom if kept undisturbed for some time. This process is called sedimentation. The clear liquid is then poured off carefully. This process is called decantation. Another example of decantation is the regeneration of used chiral stationary phase (CSP). The CSP to be decanted is gently mixed in a container with a compatible solvent to form a suspension. The suspension is allowed to rest for a period of time, after which the supernatant is carefully poured off. The supernatant contains the undesirable constituents of the former suspension, while the leftover sediment in the container is clean, reusable CSP. Decantation should be done directly after sedimentation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Distillation	Distillation	Distillation is a method of separating mixtures based on differences in volatility of components in a boiling liquid mixture. Distillation is a unit operation, or a physical separation process, and not a chemical reaction. Commercially, distillation has a number of applications. It is used to separate crude oil into more fractions for specific uses such as transport, power generation and heating. Water is distilled to remove impurities, such as salt from seawater. Air is distilled to separate its componentsâ€”notably oxygen, nitrogen, and argonâ€” for industrial use. Distillation of fermented solutions has been used since ancient times to produce distilled beverages with a higher alcohol content. The premises where distillation is carried out, especially distillation of alcohol, are known as a distillery. A still is the apparatus used for distillation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Filtration	Filtration	Filtration is commonly the mechanical or physical operation which is used for the separation of solids from fluids (liquids or gases) by interposing a medium through which only the fluid can pass. Oversize solids in the fluid are retained, but the separation is not complete; solids will be contaminated with some fluid and filtrate will contain fine particles (depending on the pore size and filter thickness). Filtration is also used to describe some biological processes, especially in water treatment and sewage treatment in which undesirable constituents are removed by absorption into a biological film grown on or in the filter medium as in slow sand filtration.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/K-Casein	K-Casein	K-Casein (or Kappa-casein, k casein, kappa casein) is a mammalian milk protein involved in a number of important physiological processes. In the gut, the ingested protein is split into an insoluble peptide (para kappa-casein) and a soluble hydrophilic glycopeptide (caseinomacropeptide). Caseinomacropeptide is responsible for increased efficiency of digestion, prevention of neonate hypersensitivity to ingested proteins, and inhibition of gastric pathogens.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kodecyte	Kodecyte	The two FSL constructs on the left are FSL-peptides based on partially carboxymethylated oligoglycine (CMG2) spacers with 1,2- dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (DOPE) lipids. The 3rd and 4th constructs are FSL-biotin based on CMG but with DOPE and sterol (Î´-oxycarbonylaminovaleric acid derivative of cholesterol) lipids, respectively. The final FSL construct is a typical trisaccharide, conjugated via an O(CH2)3NH spacer to an activated adipate derivative of the diacyl lipid DOPE. ]] A kodecyte is a living cell that has been modified (koded) by the incorporation of one or more function-spacer-lipid constructs (FSL constructs) to gain a new or novel biological, chemical or technological function. The cell is modified by the lipid tail of the FSL construct incoporating into the bilipid membrane of the cell. All kodecytes retain their normal vitality and functionality while gaining the new function of the inserted FSL constructs. The combination of dispersibility in biocompatible media, spontaneous incorporation into cell membranes, and apparent low toxicity, makes FSL constructs suitable as research tools and for the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic applications.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/LIESST	LIESST	In chemistry and physics, LIESST (Light-Induced Excited Spin-State Trapping) is a method of changing the electronic spin state of a compound by means of irradiation with light. Many transition metal complexes with electronic configuration d-d are capable of spin crossover (and d when molecular symmetry is lower than Oh). Spin crossover refers to where a transition from the high spin (HS) state to the low spin (LS) state or vice versa occurs. Alternatives to LIESST include using thermal changes and pressure to induce spin crossover. The metal most commonly exhibiting spin crossover is iron, with the first known example, an iron(III) tris(dithiocarbamato) complex, reported by Cambi et al. in 1931. For iron complexes, LIESST involves excitation of the low spin complex with green light to a triplet state. Two successive steps of intersystem crossing result in the high spin complex. Movement from the high spin complex to the low spin complex requires excitation with red light.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laboratory_automation	Laboratory automation	Laboratory automation is a multi-disciplinary strategy to research, develop, optimize and capitalize on technologies in the laboratory that enable new and improved processes. Laboratory automation professionals are academic, commercial and government researchers, scientists and engineers who conduct research and develop new technologies to increase productivity, elevate experimental data quality, reduce lab process cycle times, or enable experimentation that otherwise would be impossible. The most widely known application of laboratory automation technology is laboratory robotics. More generally, the field of laboratory automation comprises many different automated laboratory instruments, devices, software algorithms, and methodologies used to enable, expedite and increase the efficiency and effectiveness of scientific research in laboratories. The application of technology in today's laboratories is required to achieve timely progress and remain competitive. Laboratories devoted to activities such as high-throughput screening, combinatorial chemistry, automated clinical and analytical testing, diagnostics, large scale biorepositories, and many others, would not exist without advancements in laboratory automation. Some universities offer entire programs that focus on lab technologies. For example, Indiana University-Purdue University at Indianapolis offers a graduate program devoted to Laboratory Informatics. Also, the Keck Graduate Institute in California offers a graduate degree with an emphasis on development of assays, instrumentation and data analysis tools required for clinical diagnostics, high-throughput screening, genotyping, microarray technologies, proteomics, imaging and other applications.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laboratory_centrifuge	Laboratory centrifuge	A laboratory centrifuge is a piece of laboratory equipment, driven by a motor, which spins liquid samples at high speed. There are various types of centrifuges, depending on the size and the sample capacity. Like all other centrifuges, laboratory centrifuges work by the sedimentation principle, where the centripetal acceleration is used to separate substances of greater and lesser density.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lipofection	Lipofection	Lipofection is a technique used to inject genetic material into a cell by means of liposomes, which are vesicles that can easily merge with the cell membrane since they are both made of a phospholipid bilayer. Lipofection generally uses a positively charged lipid to form an aggregate with the negatively charged genetic material. A net positive charge on this aggregrate has been assumed to increase the effectiveness of transfection through the negatively charged phospholipid bilayer. This transfection technology performs the same tasks as other biochemical procedures utilizing polymers, DEAE dextran, calcium phosphate, and electroporation. The main advantages of lipofection are its high efficiency, its ability to transfect all types of nucleic acids in a wide range of cell types, its ease of use, reproducibility, and low toxicity. In addition, this method is suitable for all transfection applications (transient, stable, co-transfection, reverse, sequential or multiple transfections). High throughput screening assay has also shown good efficiency in some in vivo models.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liquid_gas	Liquid gas	Due to the age of this content, you may be looking for: Liquefaction of gases liquid oxygen liquid nitrogen Liquid hydrogen Liquid helium paramagnetism (oxygen) superconducting metals ferromagnetism (magnets) liquified petroleum gas Liquid gas: Low temperatures have very marked effects upon the magnetic properties of various substances. Oxygen, long known to be slightly magnetic in the gaseous state, is powerfully attracted in the liquid condition by a magnet, and the same is true, though to a less extent, of liquid air, owing to the proportion of liquid oxygen it contains. A magnet of ordinary carbon steel has its magnetic moment temporarily increased by cooling, that is, after it has been brought to a permanent magnetic condition (aged). The effect of the first immersion of such a magnet in liquid air is a large diminution in its magnetic moment, which decreases still further when it is allowed to warm up to ordinary temperatures. A second cooling, however, increases the magnetic moment, which is again decreased by warming, and after a few repetitions of this cycle of cooling and heating the steel is brought into a condition such that its magnetic moment at the temperature of liquid air is greater by a constant percentage than it is at the ordinary temperature of the air. The increase of magnetic moment seems then to have reached a limit, because on further cooling to the temperature of liquid hydrogen hardly any further increase is observed. The percentage differs with the composition of the steel and with its physical condition. It is greater, for example, with a specimen tempered very soft than it is with another specimen of the same steel tempered glass hard. Aluminium steels show the same kind of phenomena as carbon ones, and the same may be said of chrome steels in the permanent condition, though the effect of the first cooling with them is a slight increase of magnetic moment. Nickel steels present some curious phenomena. When containing small percentages of nickel (e.g. 084 or 3-82), they behave under changes of temperature much like carbon steel. With a sample containing 7.65%, the phenomena after the permanent state had been reached were similar, but the first cooling produced a slight increase in magnetic moment. But steels containing 18-64 and 29% of nickel behaved very differently. The result of the first cooling was a reduction of the magnetic moment, to the extent of nearly 50% in the case of the former. Warming again brought about an increase, and the final condition was that at the barometric pressure of liquid air the magnetic moment was always less than at ordinary temperatures. This anomaly is all the more remarkable in that the behaviour of pure nickel is normal, as also appears to be generally the case with soft and hard iron. Silicon, tungsten and manganese steels are also substantially normal in their behaviour, although there are considerable differences in the magnitudes of the variations they display.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Low_copy_number	Low copy number	Low Copy Number (LCN) is a DNA profiling technique developed by the Forensic Science Service (FSS) and in use in some countries since 1999. In the United Kingdom use of the technique was suspended between 21 December 2007 and 14 January 2008 while the Crown Prosecution Service conducted a review into its use - this suspension has now been lifted. LCN is an extension of Second Generation Multiplex Plus (SGM Plus) profiling technique. It is a more sensitive technique because it involves a greater amount of copying from a smaller amount of starting material, meaning that a profile can be obtained from only a few cells, which may be as small as a millionth the size of a grain of salt, and amount to a just few cells of skin or sweat left from a fingerprint.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/MS2_tagging	MS2 tagging	Techniques based upon the interaction of the MS2 bacteriophage coat protein with a stem loop structure from the phage genome. Used for biochemical purification of RNA-protein complexes and partnered to GFP for detection of RNA in living cells. More recently, the technique has been used to monitor the appearance of RNA in living cells, at the site of transcription, or simply by observing the changes in RNA number in the cytoplasm. This has revealed that transcription of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic genes occurs in a discontinuous fashion with bursts of transcription separated by irregular intervals.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Magnetofection	Magnetofection	Magnetofection is a simple and highly efficient transfection method that uses magnetic fields to concentrate particles containing nucleic acid into the target cells. This method attempts to unite the advantages of the popular biochemical (cationic lipids or polymers) and physical transfection methods in one system while excluding their inconveniences (low efficiency, toxicity). Magnetofection was invented by Christian Plank and Christian Bergemann and is registered as a trademark.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metallurgical_assay	Metallurgical assay	A metallurgical assay is a compositional analysis of an ore, metal, or alloy. Some assay methods are suitable for raw materials; others are more appropriate for finished goods. Raw precious metals are assayed by an assay office. Silver is assayed by titration, gold by cupellation and platinum by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES). Precious metal items of art or jewelry are frequently hallmarked (depending upon the requirements of the laws of either the place of manufacture or the place of import). Where required to be hallmarked, semi-finished precious metal items of art or jewelry pass through the official testing channels where they are analyzed or assayed for precious metal content. While different nations permit a variety of legally acceptable finenesses, the assayer is actually testing to determine that the fineness of the product conforms with the statement or claim of fineness that the maker has claimed (usually by stamping a number such as 750 for 18k gold) on the item. In the past the assay was conducted by using the touchstone method but currently (most often) it is done using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). XRF is used because this method is more exacting than the touchstone test. The most exact method of assay is known as fire assay or cupellation. This method is better suited for the assay of bullion and gold stocks rather than works or art or jewelry because it is a completely destructive method.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Most_probable_number	Most probable number	The most probable number method, otherwise known as the method of Poisson zeroes, is a method of getting quantitative data on concentrations of discrete items from positive/negative (incidence) data. There are many discrete entities that are easily detected but difficult to count. Any sort of amplification reaction or catalysis reaction obliterates easy quantification but allows presence to be detected very sensitively. Common examples include microorganism growth, enzyme action, or catalytic chemistry. The MPN method involves taking the original solution or sample, and subdividing it by orders of magnitude (frequently 10Ã— or 2Ã—), and assessing presence/absence in multiple subdivisions. The degree of dilution at which absence begins to appear indicates that the items have been diluted so much that there are many subsamples in which none appear. A suite of replicates at any given concentration allow finer resolution, to use the number of positive and negative samples to estimate the original concentration within the appropriate order of magnitude. In microbiology, the cultures are incubated and assessed by eye, bypassing tedious colony counting or expensive and tedious microscopic counts. In molecular biology, a common application involves DNA templates diluted into polymerase chain reaction (PCR) reactions. Reactions only proceed when a template is present, allowing for a form of quantitative PCR, to assess the original concentration of template molecules. Another application involves diluting enzyme stocks into solution containing a chromogenic substrate, or diluting antigens into solutions for ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay) or some other antibody cascade detection reaction, to measure the original concentration of the enzyme or antigen. The major weakness of MPN methods is the need for large numbers of replicates at the appropriate dilution to narrow the confidence intervals. However, it is a very important method for counts when the appropriate order of magnitude is unknown a priori and sampling is necessarily destructive.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multielectrode_array	Multielectrode array	Multielectrode arrays (MEAs) or microelectrode arrays are devices that contain multiple plates or shanks through which neural signals are obtained or delivered, essentially serving as neural interfaces that connect neurons to electronic circuitry. There are two general classes of MEAs: implantable MEAs, used in vivo, and non-implantable MEAs, used in vitro.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiplex_(assay)	Multiplex (assay)	"For other uses of multiplex, see multiplex (disambiguation). A multiplex assay is a type of assay that simultaneously measures multiple analytes (dozens or more) in a single run/cycle of the assay. It is distinguished from procedures that measure one analyte at a time. Multiplex assays within a given application area or class of technology can be further stratified based on how many analytes can be measured per assay, where ""multiplex"" refers to those with the highest number of analyte measurements per assay (up to millions) and ""low-plex"" or ""mid-plex"" refers to procedures that process fewer (10s to 1000s), though there are no formal guidelines for calling a procedure multi-, mid-, or low-plex based on number of analytes measured. Single-analyte assays or low-to-mid-plex procedures typically predate the rise of their multiplex versions, which often require specialized technologies or miniaturization to achieve a higher degree of parallelization. Multiplex assays are widely used in functional genomics experiments that endeavor to detect or to assay the state of all biomolecules of a given class within a biological sample, to determine the effect of an experimental treatment or the effect of a DNA mutation over all of the biomolecules or pathways in the sample. The ability to perform such multiplex assay experiments measuring large numbers of biomolecular analytes has been facilitated by the completion of the human genome sequence and that of many other model organisms."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiplex_ligation-dependent_probe_amplification	Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification	Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA)http://www. mlpa. com is a variation of the multiplex polymerase chain reaction that permits multiple targets to be amplified with only a single primer pair. Each probe consists of two oligonucleotides which recognise adjacent target sites on the DNA. One probe oligonucleotide contains the sequence recognised by the forward primer, the other the sequence recognised by the reverse primer. Only when both probe oligonucleotides are hybridised to their respective targets, can they be ligated into a complete probe. The advantage of splitting the probe into two parts is that only the ligated oligonucleotides, but not the unbound probe oligonucleotides, are amplified. If the probes were not split in this way, the primer sequences at either end would cause the probes to be amplified regardless of their hybridization to the template DNA, and the amplification product would not be dependent on the number of target sites present in the sample DNA. Each complete probe has a unique length, so that its resulting amplicons can be separated and identified by (capillary) electrophoresis. This avoids the resolution limitations of multiplex PCR. Since the forward primer used for probe amplification is fluorescently labeled, each amplicon generates a fluorescent peak which can be detected by a capillary sequencer. Comparing the peak pattern obtained on a given sample with that obtained on various reference samples, the relative quantity of each amplicon can be determined. This ratio is a measure for the ratio in which the target sequence is present in the sample DNA. Various techniques including DGGE, DHPLC, and SSCA effectively identify SNPs and small insertions and deletions. MLPA, however, is one of the only accurate, time-efficient techniques to detect genomic deletions and insertions (one or more entire exons), which are frequent causes of cancers such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer, breast, and ovarian cancer. MLPA can successfully and easily determine the relative copy number of all exons within a gene simultaneously with high sensitivity.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Multiplex_polymerase_chain_reaction	Multiplex polymerase chain reaction	Multiplex polymerase chain reaction (Multiplex PCR) is a modification of polymerase chain reaction in order to rapidly detect deletions or duplications in a large gene. This process amplifies genomic DNA samples using multiple primers and a temperature-mediated DNA polymerase in a thermal cycler. Multiplex-PCR was first described in 1988 as a method to detect deletions in the dystrophin gene. It has also been used with the steroid sulfatase gene. In 2008, multiplex-PCR was used for analysis of microsatellites and SNPs. Multiplex-PCR consists of multiple primer sets within a single PCR mixture to produce amplicons of varying sizes that are specific to different DNA sequences. By targeting multiple genes at once, additional information may be gained from a single test run that otherwise would require several times the reagents and more time to perform. Annealing temperatures for each of the primer sets must be optimized to work correctly within a single reaction, and amplicon sizes, i.e. , their base pair length, should be different enough to form distinct bands when visualized by gel electrophoresis. Commercial multiplexing kits for PCR are available and used by many forensic laboratories to amplify degraded DNA samples. Commercial kits have a number of advantages over in-house multiplexing methods. Quality control measures are undertaken by the manufacturer of the kit and ensure that reactions are uniform across all kits. This avoids the preparation of PCR master mixes which require pipetting and use of multiple assay tubes, increasing the risk of operator error and contamination. This increased reliability allows profiles obtained from commercial kits to be admitted into court which is pivotal in large criminal trials. The use of specific kits over a number of laboratories also allows for profile results to be compared as long as the same STR markers have been used in each kit.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nanovid_microscopy	Nanovid microscopy	Nanovid microscopy, from â€œnanometer video-enhanced microscopyâ€ﾝ, is a microscopic technique aimed at visualizing colloidal gold particles of 20-40 nm diameter as dynamic markers at the light microscopic level. The nanogold particles as such are smaller than the diffraction limit of light, but can be visualized by using Video-Enhanced Differential Interference Contrast (VEDIC). The technique is based on the use of contrast enhancement by video techniques and digital image processing. Nanovid microscopy, by combining small colloidal gold probes with video-enhanced quantitative microscopy, allows for studying the intracellular dynamics of specific proteins in living cells.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nested_polymerase_chain_reaction	Nested polymerase chain reaction	Nested polymerase chain reaction is a modification of polymerase chain reaction intended to reduce non-specific binding in products due to the amplification of unexpected primer binding sites. Polymerase chain reaction itself is the process used to amplify DNA samples, via a temperature-mediated DNA polymerase. The products can be used for sequencing or analysis, and this process is a key part of many genetics research laboratories, along with uses in DNA fingerprinting for forensics and other human genetic cases. Conventional PCR requires primers complementary to the termini of the target DNA. A commonly occurring problem is primers binding to incorrect regions of the DNA, giving unexpected products. Nested polymerase chain reaction involves two sets of primers, used in two successive runs of polymerase chain reaction, the second set intended to amplify a secondary target within the first run product.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nick_translation	Nick translation	"Nick translation (or Head Translation) was developed in 1977 by Rigby and Paul Berg. It is a tagging technique in molecular biology in which DNA Polymerase I is used to replace some of the nucleotides of a DNA sequence with their labeled analogues, creating a tagged DNA sequence which can be used as a probe in Fluorescent in situ hybridization or blotting techniques. It can also be used for radiolabeling. This process is called nick translation because the DNA to be processed is treated with DNase to produce single-stranded ""nicks. "" This is followed by replacement in nicked sites by DNA polymerase I, which elongates the 3' hydroxyl terminus, removing nucleotides by 5'-3' exonuclease activity, replacing them with dNTPs. To radioactively label a DNA fragment for use as a probe in blotting procedures, one of the incorporated nucleotides provided in the reaction is radiolabeled in the alpha phosphate position. Similarly, a fluorophore can be attached instead for fluorescent labelling, or an antigen for immunodetection. When DNA polymerase I eventually detaches from the DNA, it leaves another nick in the phosphate backbone. The nick has ""translated"" some distance depending on the processivity of the polymerase. This nick could be sealed by DNA ligase, or its 3' hydroxyl group could serve as the template for further DNA polymerase I activity. Proprietary enzyme mixes are available commercially to perform all steps in the procedure in a single incubation. Nick translation could cause double-stranded DNA breaks, if DNA polymerase I encounters another nick on the opposite strand, resulting in two shorter fragments. This does not influence the performance of the labelled probe in in-situ hybridization."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Patch_clamp	Patch clamp	The patch clamp technique is a laboratory technique in electrophysiology that allows the study of single or multiple ion channels in cells. The technique can be applied to a wide variety of cells, but is especially useful in the study of excitable cells such as neurons, cardiomyocytes, muscle fibers and pancreatic beta cells. It can also be applied to the study of bacterial ion channels in specially prepared giant spheroplasts. The patch clamp technique is a refinement of the voltage clamp. Erwin Neher and Bert Sakmann developed the patch clamp in the late 1970s and early 1980s. This discovery made it possible to record the currents of single ion channels for the first time, proving their involvement in fundamental cell processes such as action potential conduction. Neher and Sakmann received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1991 for this work.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligomer_restriction	Oligomer restriction	Oligomer Restriction (abbreviated OR) is a procedure to detect an altered DNA sequence in a genome. A labeled oligonucleotide probe is hybridized to a target DNA, and then treated with a restriction enzyme. If the probe exactly matches the target, the restriction enzyme will cleave the probe, changing its size. If, however, the target DNA does not exactly match the probe, the restriction enzyme will have no effect on the length of the probe. The OR technique, now rarely performed, was closely associated with the development of the popular polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_culture	Organ culture	Organ culture is a development from tissue culture methods of research, the organ culture is able to accurately model functions of an organ in various states and conditions by the use of the actual in vitro organ itself. Parts of an organ or a whole organ can be cultured in vitro. The main objective is to maintain the architecture of the tissue and direct it towards normal development. In this technique, it is essential that the tissue is never disrupted or damaged. It thus requires careful handling. The media used for a growing organ culture are generally the same as those used for tissue culture. The techniques for organ culture can be classified into (i) those employing a solid medium and (ii) those employing liquid medium.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overlap_extension_polymerase_chain_reaction	Overlap extension polymerase chain reaction	This page assumes familiarity with the terms and components used in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) process. The overlap extension polymerase chain reaction (or OE-PCR) is a variant of PCR. It is also referred to as Splicing by overlap extension / Splicing by overhang extension (SOE) PCR. It is used to insert specific mutations at specific points in a sequence or to splice smaller DNA fragments into a larger polynucleotide.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Overlay_assay	Overlay assay	An overlay assay is a biological technique used to find proteins that bind to a protein of interest. It begins with proteins that are dispersed but fixed (e.g. a tissue slice or run on a membrane by gel electrophoresis) and then incubated in the labelled protein of interest. The label will indicate the location of proteins that bind to the protein of interest.

Particle size analysis, particle size measurement, or simply particle sizing is the collective name of the technical procedures, or laboratory techniques which determines the size range, and/or the average, or mean size of the particles in a powder sample. Particle size analysis is part of Particle Science, and its determination is carried out generally in particle technology laboratories. The particle size can have considerable importance in a number of industries including the chemical, mining, forestry, agriculture, and aggregate industries.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Peptide_mass_fingerprinting	Peptide mass fingerprinting	Peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) (also known as protein fingerprinting) is an analytical technique for protein identification that was developed in 1993 by several groups independently. In this method, the unknown protein of interest is first cleaved into smaller peptides, whose absolute masses can be accurately measured with a mass spectrometer such as MALDI-TOF or ESI-TOF. These masses are then compared to either a database containing known protein sequences or even the genome. This is achieved by using computer programs that translate the known genome of the organism into proteins, then theoretically cut the proteins into peptides, and calculate the absolute masses of the peptides from each protein. They then compare the masses of the peptides of the unknown protein to the theoretical peptide masses of each protein encoded in the genome. The results are statistically analyzed to find the best match. The advantage of this method is that only the masses of the peptides have to be known. Time-consuming de novo peptide sequencing is then unnecessary. A disadvantage is that the protein sequence has to be present in the database of interest. Additionally most PMF algorithms assume that the peptides come from a single protein. The presence of a mixture can significantly complicate the analysis and potentially compromise the results. Typical for the PMF based protein identification is the requirement for an isolated protein. Mixtures exceeding a number of 2-3 proteins typically require the additional use of MS/MS based protein identification to achieve sufficient specificity of identification (6). Therefore, the typical PMF samples are isolated proteins from Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D gels) or isolated SDS-PAGE bands. Additional analyses by MS/MS can either be direct, e.g. , MALDI-TOF/TOF analysis or downstream nanoLC-ESI-MS/MS analysis of gel spot eluates.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polymerase_cycling_assembly	Polymerase cycling assembly	Polymerase cycling assembly (or PCA, also known as Assembly PCR) is a method for the assembly of large DNA oligonucleotides from shorter fragments. The process uses the same technology as PCR, but takes advantage of DNA hybridization and annealing as well as DNA polymerase to amplify a complete sequence of DNA in a precise order based on the single stranded oligonucleotides used in the process. It thus allows for the production of synthetic genes and even entire synthetic genomes.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein_tag	Protein tag	Protein tags are peptide sequences genetically grafted onto a recombinant protein. Often these tags are removable by chemical agents or by enzymatic means, such as proteolysis or intein splicing. Tags are attached to proteins for various purposes. Affinity tags are appended to proteins so that they can be purified from their crude biological source using an affinity technique. These include chitin binding protein (CBP), maltose binding protein (MBP), and glutathione-S-transferase (GST). The poly(His) tag is a widely-used protein tag; it binds to metal matrices. Solubilization tags are used, especially for recombinant proteins expressed in chaperone-deficient species such as E. coli, to assist in the proper folding in proteins and keep them from precipitating. These include thioredoxin (TRX) and poly(NANP). Some affinity tags have a dual role as a solubilization agent, such as MBP, and GST. Chromatography tags are used to alter chromatographic properties of the protein to afford different resolution across a particular separation technique. Often, these consist of polyanionic amino acids, such as FLAG-tag. Epitope tags are short peptide sequences which are chosen because high-affinity antibodies can be reliably produced in many different species. These are usually derived from viral genes, which explain their high immunoreactivity. Epitope tags include V5-tag, c-myc-tag, and HA-tag. These tags are particularly useful for western blotting, immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation experiments, although they also find use in antibody purification. Fluorescence tags are used to give visual readout on a protein. GFP and its variants are the most commonly used fluorescence tags. More advanced applications of GFP include using it as a folding reporter (fluorescent if folded, colorless if not). Protein tags find many other usages, such as specific enzymatic modification (such as biotin ligase tags) and chemical modification (FlAsH) tag. Often tags are combined to produce multifunctional modifications of the protein. However, with the addition of each tag comes the risk that the native function of the protein may be abolished or compromised by interactions with the tag.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protomap_(proteomics)	Protomap (proteomics)	PROTOMAP is a recently developed proteomic technology for identifying changes to proteins that manifest in altered migration by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. It is similar, conceptually, to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and difference gel electrophoresis in that it enables global identification of proteins that undergo altered electrophoretic migration resulting from, for example, proteolysis or post-translational modification. However, it is unique in that all proteins are sequenced using mass spectrometry which provides information on the sequence coverage detected in each isoform of each protein thereby facilitating interpretation of proteolytic events. PROTOMAP is performed by resolving control and experimental samples in separate lanes of a 1D SDS-PAGE gel. Each lane is cut into evenly spaced bands (usually 15-30 bands) and proteins in these bands are sequenced using shotgun proteomics. Sequence information from all of these bands are bioinformatically integrated into a visual format called a peptograph which plots gel-migration in the vertical dimension (high- to low-molecular weight, top to bottom) and sequence coverage in the horizontal dimension (N- to C-terminus, left to right). A peptograph is generated for each protein the sample (thousands of peptographs are generated from a single experiment) and this data format enables rapid identification of proteins undergoing proteolytic cleavage by making evident changes in gel-migration that are accompanied by altered topography. PROTOMAP stands for PRotein TOpography and Migration Analysis Platform and was invented and developed by Ben Cravatt and colleagues at The Scripps Research Institute.

Using a combination of restriction enzymes some of which are specific to DNA modifications, the technique can be used to visualize differences in methylation levels across the genome of a given organism. RLGS employs direct labeling of DNA, which is first cut by a specific series of restriction enzymes, and then labeled by a radioactive isotope. A two-dimensional electrophoresis process is then employed, yielding high-resolution results. The radioactive second-dimension gel is then allowed to expose a large sheet of film. The radiation produced by the radioactive labeling will cause the film to be exposed wherever the restriction fragments have migrated during electrophoresis. The film is then developed, yielding a visual representation of the results in the form of an autoradiograph. The same combination of restriction enzymes will produce the same pattern of 'spots' from samples from the same organisms, but different patterns for different types of organism. For example, human and mouse DNA will produce distinctly different patterns when treated with the same combination of enzymes. These finished auto-rads can be examined against each other, revealing any changes in gene expression that lead to visual differences in the film. Each autoradiograph contains thousands of spots, each corresponding to a labeled DNA restriction landmark. RLGS becomes very useful when doing whole-genome scans, and can effectively do the work of thousands of polymerase chain reactions at once. It readily detects alterations deviating from normal, and thus is exceptionally effective in identifying hyper/hypomethylation in tumors, deletions or amplifications of genes, or simply changes in gene expression throughout the development of an organism.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reverse_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction	Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is one of many variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). This technique is commonly used in molecular biology to detect RNA expression levels. RT-PCR is often confused with real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) by students and scientists alike. However, they are separate and distinct techniques. While RT-PCR is used to qualitatively detect gene expression through creation of complementary DNA (cDNA) transcripts from RNA, qPCR is used to quantitatively measure the amplification of DNA using fluorescent probes. qPCR is also referred to as quantitative PCR, quantitative real-time PCR, and real-time quantitative PCR. Although RT-PCR and the traditional PCR both produce multiple copies of particular DNA isolates through amplification, the applications of the two techniques are fundamentally different. The traditional PCR is simply used to exponentially amplify given DNA sequences. RT-PCR is used to clone expressed genes by reverse transcribing the RNA of interest into its DNA complement through the use of reverse transcriptase. Subsequently, the newly synthesized cDNA is amplified using traditional PCR. In addition to qualitative study of gene expression, RT-PCR can be utilized for quantification of RNA, in both relative and absolute terms, by incorporating qPCR into the technique. The combined technique, described as quantitative RT-PCR or real-time RT-PCR (sometimes even quantitative real-time RT-PCR), is often abbreviated as qRT-PCR, RT-qPCR, or RRT-PCR. Compared to other RNA quantification methods, such as northern blot, qRT-PCR is considered to be the most powerful, sensitive, and quantitative assay for the detection of RNA levels. It is frequently used in the expression analysis of single or multiple genes, and expression patterns for identifying infections and diseases. In order to avoid confusion, the following abbreviations will be used consistently throughout this article:
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ribosomal_Intergenic_Spacer_analysis	Ribosomal Intergenic Spacer analysis	Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) intergenic spacer analysis (RISA) is a method of microbial community analysis that provides a means of comparing differing environments or treatment impacts without the bias imposed by culture- dependent approaches. This type of analysis is often referred to as community fingerprinting. RISA involves PCR amplification of a region of the rRNA gene operon between the small and large subunits called the intergenic spacer region ISR. By using oligonucleotide primers targeted to conserved regions in the 16S and 23S genes, RISA fragments can be generated from most of the dominant bacteria in an environmental sample. While the majority of the rRNA operon serves a structural function, portions of the 16S-23S intergenic region can encode tRNAs depending on the bacterial species. However the taxonomic value of the ISR lies in the significant heterogeneity in both length and nucleotide sequence. In RISA, we attempt to exploit the length heterogeneity of the ISR, which has been shown to range between 150 and 1500 bp with the majority of the ISR lengths being between 150 and 500 bp. The resulting PCR product will be a mixture of fragments contributed by several dominant community members. This product is electrophoresed in a polyacrylamide gel, and the DNA is visualized following staining. The result is a complex banding pattern that provides a community-specific profile, with each DNA band corresponding to a bacterial population on the original assemblage.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sparging_(chemistry)	Sparging (chemistry)	In chemistry, sparging, also known as gas flushing in metallurgy, is a technique which involves bubbling a chemically inert gas, such as nitrogen, argon, or helium, through a liquid. This can be used to remove dissolved gases from the liquid.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sublimation_(phase_transition)	Sublimation (phase transition)	Sublimation is the transition of a substance directly from the solid phase to the gas phase without passing through an intermediate liquid phase. Sublimation is an endothermic phase transition that occurs at temperatures and pressures below a substance's triple point in its phase diagram. At normal pressures, most chemical compounds and elements possess three different states at different temperatures. In these cases, the transition from the solid to the gaseous state requires an intermediate liquid state. Note, however, that the pressure referred to here is the partial pressure of the substance, not the total (e.g. , atmospheric) pressure of the entire system. So, all solids that possess an appreciable vapor pressure at a certain temperature usually can sublime in air (e.g. , water ice just below 0Â°C). For some substances, such as carbon and arsenic, sublimation is much easier than evaporation from the melt, because the pressure of their triple point is very high, and it is difficult to obtain them as liquids. Sublimation requires additional energy and is an endothermic change. The enthalpy of sublimation (also called heat of sublimation) can be calculated as the enthalpy of fusion plus the enthalpy of vaporization. The reverse process of sublimation is deposition. The formation of frost is an example of meteorological deposition.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salting_out	Salting out	Salting out (also known as antisolvent crystallization, precipitation crystallization, or drowning out) is a effect based on the electrolyte-nonelectrolyte interaction. It is used as method of separating proteins based on the principle that proteins are less soluble at high salt concentrations. The salt concentration needed for the protein to precipitate out of the solution differs from protein to protein. This process is also used to concentrate dilute solutions of proteins. Dialysis can be used to remove the salt if needed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedimentation_coefficient	Sedimentation coefficient	The sedimentation coefficient s of a particle is used to characterize its behaviour in sedimentation processes, notably centrifugation. It is defined as the ratio of a particle's sedimentation velocity to the acceleration that is applied to it (causing the sedimentation). The sedimentation speed is also known as the terminal velocity. It is constant because the force applied to a particle by gravity or by a centrifuge (measuring typically in multiples of tens of thousands of gravities in an ultracentrifuge) is cancelled by the viscous resistance of the medium through which the particle is moving. The applied acceleration a can be either the gravitational acceleration g, or more commonly the centrifugal acceleration . In the latter case, is the angular velocity of the rotor and r is the distance of a particle to the rotor axis. The viscous resistance is given by the Stokes' law: 6Ï€Î·r0v where Î· is the viscosity of the medium, r0 is the radius of the particle and v is the velocity of the particle. This law applies only for large spheres in an infinite sea of the fluid. The centrifugal force is given by the familiar equation: mrÏ‰. Here r is the distance of the particle from the axis of rotation. When the two forces (viscous force and the centrifugal force) balance (they are oppositely directed), the particle moves with constant velocity called the terminal velocity. Hence the terminal velocity is given by the following equation. Rearranging this equation we get the final formula: The sedimentation coefficient has the dimensions of a unit of time and is expressed in svedbergs. One svedberg is defined as exactly 10Â s. Essentially the sedimentation coefficient serves to normalize the sedimentation rate of a particle by the acceleration applied to it. The resulting value is no longer dependent on the acceleration, but depends only on the properties of the particle and the medium in which it is suspended. Sedimentation coefficients quoted in literature usually pertain to sedimentation in water at 20Â°C. Bigger particles sediment faster and have higher sedimentation coefficients (svedberg, or S values). Sedimentation coefficients are, however, not additive. Sedimentation rate does not depend only on the mass or volume of a particle, and when two particles bind together there is inevitably a loss of surface area. Thus when measured separately they will have svedberg values that may not add up to that of the bound particle. This is notably the case with the ribosome. Ribosomes are most often identified by their sedimentation coefficient. For instance, the 70 S ribosome that comes from bacteria actually has a sedimentation coefficient of 70 svedberg. It is composed of a 50 S subunit and a 30 S subunit.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serial_dilution	Serial dilution	A serial dilution is the stepwise dilution of a substance in solution. Usually the dilution factor at each step is constant, resulting in a geometric progression of the concentration in a logarithmic fashion. A ten-fold serial dilution could be 1 M, 0.1 M, 0.01 M, 0.001 M... Serial dilutions are used to accurately create highly diluted solutions as well as solutions for experiments resulting in concentration curves with a logarithmic scale. A tenfold dilution for each step is called a logarithmic dilution or log-dilution, a 3.16-fold (10-fold) dilution is called a half-logarithmic dilution or half-log dilution, and a 1.78-fold (10-fold) dilution is called a quarter-logarithmic dilution or quarter-log dilution. Serial dilutions are widely used in experimental sciences, including biochemistry, pharmacology, microbiology, and physics.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sham-operated_group	Sham-operated group	A sham-operated group is a control group in a laboratory experiment. It is a control of scientific studies involving a surgical procedure, ensuring that the scientific data reflect the effects of the experiment itself, and are not merely a consequence of the surgery. The sham-operated control group has received exactly the same surgical procedure as the experimental group, without the treatment under study.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Single_particle_tracking	Single particle tracking	Single particle tracking (SPT) is the observation of the motion of individual particles within a medium. The coordinates (x, y, z) over a series of time steps is referred to as a trajectory. The trajectory can be analyzed to identify modes of motion or heterogeneities in the motion such as obstacles or regions of fast transport (e.g. due to active transport or flow), in the case of random motion trajectory analysis can provide a diffusion coefficient.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Size-exclusion_chromatography	Size-exclusion chromatography	Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) is a chromatographic method in which molecules in solution are separated by their size, and in some cases molecular weight. It is usually applied to large molecules or macromolecular complexes such as proteins and industrial polymers. Typically, when an aqueous solution is used to transport the sample through the column, the technique is known as gel-filtration chromatography, versus the name gel permeation chromatography, which is used when an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase. SEC is a widely used polymer characterization method because of its ability to provide good molar mass distribution (Mw) results for polymers.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solid-phase_microextraction	Solid-phase microextraction	Solid-phase microextraction, or SPME, is a sample preparation technique used both in the laboratory and on-site. Developed in the early 1990s at the University of Waterloo by Dr. Pawliszyn's group, it is a simple and inexpensive technique where the use of solvents is not necessary. SPME can be thought of as a very short gas chromatography column turned inside out. SPME involves the use of a fiber coated with an extracting phase, that can be a liquid or a solid, which extracts different kinds of analytes (including both volatile and non-volatile) from different kinds of media, that can be in liquid or gas phase. The quantity of analyte extracted by the fibre is proportional to its concentration in the sample as long as equilibrium is reached or, in case of short time pre-equilibrium, with help of convection or agitation. After extraction, the SPME fiber is transferred to the injection port of separating instruments, such as a Gas Chromatograph, where desorption of the analyte takes place and analysis is carried out. The attraction of SPME is that the extraction is fast and simple and can be done usually without solvents, and detection limits can reach parts per trillion (ppt) levels for certain compounds. SPME also has great potential for field applications; on-site sampling can be done even by nonscientists without the need to have gas chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment at each location. When properly stored, samples can be analyzed days later in the laboratory without significant loss of volatiles.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonication	Sonication	Sonication is the act of applying sound energy to agitate particles in a sample, for various purposes. In the laboratory, it is usually applied using an ultrasonic bath or an ultrasonic probe, colloquially known as a sonicator. In a paper machine, an ultrasonic foil can distribute cellulose fibres more uniformly and strengthen the paper.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Southwestern_blot	Southwestern blot	"Southwestern blotting, based along the lines of Southern blotting (which was created by Edwin Southern) and first described by B. Bowen, J. Steinberg and colleagues in 1980, is a lab technique which involves identifying and characterizing DNA-binding proteins by their ability to bind to specific oligonucleotide probes. The proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis and are subsequently transferred to nitrocellulose membranes similar to other types of blotting. The name southwestern blotting is based on the fact that this technique detects DNA-binding proteins, since DNA detection is by Southern blotting and protein detection is by western blotting. However, since the first southwestern blottings, many more have been proposed and discovered. The former protocols were hampered by the need for large amounts of proteins and their susceptibility to degradation while being isolated. ""Southwestern blot mapping"" is performed for rapid characterization of both DNA-binding proteins and their specific sites on genomic DNA. Proteins are separated on a polyacrylamide gel containing sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), renatured by removing SDS in the presence of urea, and blotted onto nitrocellulose by diffusion. The genomic DNA region of interest is digested by restriction enzymes selected to produce fragments of appropriate but different sizes, which are subsequently end-labeled and allowed to bind to the separated proteins. The specifically bound DNA is eluted from each individual protein-DNA complex and analyzed by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Evidence that tissue-specific DNA binding proteins may be detected by this technique has been presented. Moreover, their sequence-specific binding allows the purification of the corresponding selectively bound DNA fragments and may improve protein-mediated cloning of DNA regulatory sequences."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spin_trapping	Spin trapping	Spin trapping in chemistry is an analytical technique employed in the detection and identification of short-lived free radicals. Spin trapping involves the addition of radical to a nitrone spin trap resulting in the formation of a spin adduct, a nitroxide-based persistent radical, that can be detected using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. The spin adduct usually yields a distinctive EPR spectrum characteristic of a particular free radical that is trapped. The identity of the radical can be inferred based from the EPR spectral profile of their respective spin adducts such as the g value, but most importantly, the hyperfine-coupling constants of relevant nuclei. Unambiguous assignments of the identity of the trapped radical can often be made by using stable isotope substitution of the radicals parent compound, so that further hyperfine couplings are introduced or altered. The most commonly used spin traps are alpha-phenyl N-tertiary-butyl nitrone (PBN) and 5,5-dimethyl-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO). More rarely, C-nitroso spin traps such as 3,5-Dibromo-4-nitrosobenzenesulfonic acid (DBNBS) can be used as spin traps: often additional hyperfine information is derived, but at a cost of specificity (due to facile non-radical addition of many compounds to C-nitroso species, and subsequent oxidation of the resulting hydroxylamine). 5-Diisopropoxyphosphoryl-5-methyl-1-pyrroline-N-oxide (DIPPMPO) spin trapping has been used in measuring superoxide production in mitochondria. The use of radical-addition reactions to detect short-lived radicals was first proposed by E. G. Janzen in 1965. It is worth noting that the radical adduct (or products such as the hydroxylamine) can often be stable enough to allow non-EPR detection techniques. The groups of London, and Berliner & Khrahmtsov have used NMR to study such adducts and Timmins and co-workers used charge changes upon DBNBS trapping to isolate protein adducts for study. A major advance has been the development of anti-DMPO antibodies by Mason's group, allowing study of spin trapping reactions by a simple immuno-based techniques.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Standard_addition	Standard addition	The method of standard addition is used in instrumental analysis to determine concentration of a substance in an unknown sample by comparison to a set of samples of known concentration, similar to using a calibration curve. Standard addition can be applied to most analytical techniques and is used instead of a calibration curve to solve the matrix effect problem.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Starch_indicator	Starch indicator	Starch is often used in chemistry as an indicator for redox titrations where triiodide is present. Starch forms a very dark blue-black complex with triiodide which can be made by mixing iodine with iodide. However, the complex is not formed if only iodine or only iodide (I) is present. The colour of the starch complex is so deep, that it can be detected visually when the concentration of the iodine is as low as 0.00002 M at 20 Â°C. The colour sensitivity decreases with increasing temperature (ten times less sensitive at 50 Â°C), and upon the addition of organic solvents such as ethanol or propanone. During iodine titrations, concentrated iodine solutions must be reacted with some titrant, often thiosulfate, in order to remove most of the iodine before the starch is added. This is due to the insolubility of the starch-iodine complex which may prevent some of the iodine reacting with the titrant. Close to the end-point, the starch is added, and the titration process is resumed taking into account the amount of thiosulfate added before adding the starch. To prepare starch indicator solution, add 1 gram of starch (either corn or potato) into 10 mL of distilled water, shake well, and pour into 100 mL of boiling, distilled water. Stir thoroughly and boil for a 1 minute. Leave to cool down. If the precipitate forms, decant the supernatant and use as the indicator solution. To make solution long lasting add a pinch of mercury iodide or salicylic acid, otherwise it can spoil after a few days.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Strep-tag	Strep-tag	The Strep-tagÂ® system is a method which allows the purification and detection of proteins by affinity chromatography. The Strep-tag is a synthetic peptide consisting of eight amino acids. This peptide sequence exhibits intrinsic affinity towards Strep-Tactin, a specifically engineered streptavidin and can be N- or C- terminally fused to recombinant proteins. By exploiting the highly specific interaction, Strep-tagged proteins can be isolated in one step from crude cell lysates. Because the Strep-tag elutes under gentle, physiological conditions it is especially suited for generation of functional proteins.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Streptamer	Streptamer	The Streptamer technology allows the reversible isolation and staining of antigen-specific T-cells. This technology combines a current T-cell isolation method with the Strep-tag technology. In princible, the T-cells are separated by establishing a specific interaction between the T-cell of interest and a molecule that is conjugated to a marker, which enables the isolation. The reversibility of this interaction and the fact that it can be performed at low temperatures is the reason for the successful isolation and characterization of functional T-cells. Because T-cells remain phenotypically and functionally indistinguishable from untreated cells, this method may offer new strategies in clinical and basic T-cell research.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/TUNEL_assay	TUNEL assay	Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) is a method for detecting DNA fragmentation by labeling the terminal end of nucleic acids.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terminal_restriction_fragment_length_polymorphism	Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism	Terminal Restriction Fragment Length Polymorphism (TRFLP or sometimes T-RFLP) is a molecular biology technique for profiling of microbial communities based on the position of a restriction site closest to a labeled end of an amplified gene. The method is based on digesting a mixture of PCR amplified variants of a single gene using one or more restriction enzymes and detecting the size of each of the individual resulting terminal fragments using a DNA sequencer. The result is a graph image where the X axis represents the sizes of the fragment and the Y axis represents their fluorescence intensity.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Two-dimensional_gel_electrophoresis	Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis	Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, abbreviated as 2-DE or 2-D electrophoresis, is a form of gel electrophoresis commonly used to analyze proteins. Mixtures of proteins are separated by two properties in two dimensions on 2D gels.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Weisz-Prater_Criterion	Weisz-Prater Criterion	The Weisz-Prater Criterion is a method used to estimate the influence of pore diffusion on reaction rates in heterogeneous catalytic reactions. If the criterion is satisfied, pore diffusion limitations are negligible. The criterion is Where is the reaction rate per volume of catalyst, is the catalyst particle radius, is the reactant concentration at the particle surface, and is the effective diffusivity. Diffusion is usually in the Knudsen regime when average pore radius is less than 100 nm. For a given effectiveness factor,, and reaction order, n, the quantity is defined by the equation: for small values of beta this can be approximated using the binomial theorem: Assuming with a 1st or zero order reaction gives values of, 0.6 and 6 respectively. Therefore for many conditions, if then pore diffusion limitations can be excluded.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Western_blot	Western blot	The western blot (sometimes called the protein immunoblot) is a widely accepted analytical technique used to detect specific proteins in the given sample of tissue homogenate or extract. It uses gel electrophoresis to separate native proteins by 3-D structure or denatured proteins by the length of the polypeptide. The proteins are then transferred to a membrane, where they are stained with antibodies specific to the target protein. There are now many reagent companies that specialize in providing antibodies against tens of thousands of different proteins. Commercial antibodies can be expensive, although the unbound antibody can be reused between experiments. This method is used in the fields of molecular biology, biochemistry, immunogenetics and other molecular biology disciplines. Other related techniques include using antibodies to detect proteins in tissues and cells by immunostaining and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The method originated in the laboratory of Harry Towbin at the Friedrich Miescher Institute. The name Western blot was given to the technique by W. Neal Burnette and is a play on the name Southern blot, a technique for DNA detection developed earlier by Edwin Southern. Detection of RNA is termed northern blot and was developed by George Stark at Stanford.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Wet_laboratory	Wet laboratory	"Wet laboratories are laboratories where chemicals, drugs, or other material or biological matter are handled in liquid solutions or volatile phases, requiring direct ventilation, and specialized piped utilities (typically water and various gasses). Wet laboratory space types do not include biohazards in Levels BL-2, BL-3, and BL-4 as defined by the 1999 NIH/CDC guideline ""Biosafety in Microbiological and Biomedical Laboratories. "" The wet laboratory space types are typically located within a building specifically designed to house them. In biology, chemistry, genetics or biochemistry, the terms wet lab or wet laboratory distinguish classical benchtop experiments handling biological material from in silico (computer analysis) or other theoretical work."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Winogradsky_column	Winogradsky column	The Winogradsky column is a simple device for culturing a large diversity of microorganisms. Invented in the 1880s by Sergei Winogradsky, the device is a column of pond mud and water mixed with a carbon source such as newspaper, blackened marshmallows or egg-shells, and a sulfur source such as gypsum or egg yolk. Incubating the column in sunlight for months results in an aerobic/anaerobic gradient as well as a sulfide gradient. These two gradients promote the growth of different microorganisms such as Clostridium, Desulfovibrio, Chlorobium, Chromatium, Rhodomicrobium, and Beggiatoa, as well as many other species of bacteria, cyanobacteria, and algae. The column provides numerous gradients, depending on additive nutrients, from which the variety of aforementioned organisms can grow. The aerobic water phase and anaerobic mud or soil phase are one such distinction. Because of oxygen's low solubility in water, the water quickly becomes anoxic towards the interface of the mud and water. Anaerobic phototrophs are still present to a large extent in the mud phase, there is still capacity for biofilm creation and colony expansion, as shown in the images at right. Algae and other aerobic phototrophs are present along the surface and water of the upper half of the columns. Green growth is often attributed to these organisms.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zoo_blot	Zoo blot	A zoo blot or garden blot is a type of Southern blot that demonstrates the similarity between specific, usually protein-coding, DNA sequences of different species. A zoo blot compares animal species while a garden blot compares plant species. In order to understand the degree to which a particular gene is similar from species to species, DNA preparations from a set of species is isolated and spread over a surface. The sequence of interest is labeled and allowed to hybridize to the prepared DNA. Usually, the labeled DNA is marked with a radioactive isotope of phosphorus. The hybridization is a process that happens spontaneously: DNA pairs with complementary strands. The hybridization, however, is not perfect. The hybridization of two strands will happen even when the strands are similar but not identical. This procedure is used to detect similar or exact relationships between the DNA in question and other organisms, so the technique takes advantage of non-exact hybridization. It also allows you judge the locations of introns and exons as the latter will be far more conserved than the former.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Affinity_magnetic_separation	Affinity magnetic separation	Affinitymagnetic separation (AMS) is a laboratory tool that can efficiently isolate bacterial cells out of body fluid or cultured cells. It can also be used as a method of quantifying the pathogenicity of food, blood or feces. Another laboratory separation tool is the immunomagnetic separation (IMS), which is more suitable for the isolation of eucaryotic cells.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protein_Footprinting	Protein Footprinting	Protein footprinting involves the study of the surface of proteins to investigate protein structure or how they assemble and interact within a larger macromolecular assembly. This has been traditionally achieved through the treatment of proteins with hydroxyl radicals. Time-resolved hydroxyl radical protein footprinting employing mass spectrometry analysis was developed over a decade ago in synchrotron radiolysis studies conduced by Maleknia et al. The same year, these authors reported on the use of an electrical discharge source to effect the oxidation of proteins on millisecond timescales as proteins pass from the electrosprayed solution into the mass spectrometer These approaches have since been successfully applied in the analysis of protein structures, protein folding, protein dynamics, and proteinâ€“protein interactions. Unlike nucleic acid, proteins were found to oxidize rather than cleave on these timescales. Analysis of the products by mass spectrometry reveals that proteins to are oxidized in a limited manner (some 10-30% of total protein) at a number of amino acid side chains across the proteins. The rate or level of oxidation at the reactive amino acid side chains (Met, Cys, Trp, Tyr, Phe, His, Pro and Leu) provides a measure of their accessibility to the bulk solvent. The mechanisms of side chain oxidation was explored by performing the radiolysis reactions in 18O-labeled water. A critical feature of these experiments is the need to expose proteins to hydroxyl radicals for limited timescales on the order of 1â€“50 ms inducing 10-30% oxidation of total protein. A further requirement is to generate hydroxyl radicals from the bulk solvent (i.e. water) (equations 1 and 2) not hydrogen peroxide which can remain to oxidize proteins even without other stimuli. Equation 1 H2O â†’ H2O+â€¢ + eâ€¢ + H2O* Equation 2 H2O+â€¢ + H2O â†’ H3O+ + HOâ€¢ Hydroxyl radicals can be produced in solution by an electrical discharge within a conventional atmospheric pressure electrospray ionization (ESI) source. When a high voltage difference (~8 keV) is held between an electrospray needle and a sampling orifice to the mass analyzer, radicals can be produced in solution at the electrospray needle tip. This method was the first employed to apply protein footprinting to the study of a protein complex. A computer program has also been written to help model protein complexes using data from the RP-MS/Protein footprinting approach. RP-MS/Protein footprinting studies of protein complexes can also employ computational approaches to assist with this modeling. The application of ion mobility mass spectrometry has conclusively demonstrated that the conditions employed in RP-MS/Protein footprinting experiments do not alter the strcture of proteins Other studies have extended the method to study early onset protein damage given the radical basis of the method and the significance of oxygen based radicals in the pathogenesis of many diseases including neurological disorders and even blindness.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tissue_culture	Tissue culture	Tissue culture is the growth of tissues or cells separate from the organism. This is typically facilitated via use of a liquid, semi-solid, or solid growth medium, such as broth or agar. Tissue culture commonly refers to the culture of animal cells and tissues, with the more specific term plant tissue culture being used for plants.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Randall%E2%80%93Selitto_test	Randallâ€“Selitto test	The Randallâ€“Selitto test or paw pressure test is a technique for the measurement of the pain response in animals. It is used in basic pain research and to test the effectiveness of analgetics by observing the reaction to gradually increasing pressure on an inflamed paw. Pain is deemed to be present if the animal starts to exhibit the flight or struggle response. Randall and Selitto exploited the fact that inflammation increases pain sensitivity and this sensitivity is modifiable by analgesics. The inflammation may be induced by injecting a dry yeast suspension into the underside of the hind limb.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Primer_dimer	Primer dimer	A Primer dimer (PD) is a potential by-product in PCR, a common biotechnological method. As its name implies, a PD consists of primer molecules that have attached to each other because of strings of complementary bases in the primers. As a result, the DNA polymerase amplifies the PD, leading to competition for PCR reagents, thus potentially inhibiting amplification of the DNA sequence targeted for PCR amplification. In real-time PCR, PDs may interfere with accurate quantification.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polymerase_chain_reaction	Polymerase chain reaction	The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is a biochemical technology in molecular biology to amplify a single or a few copies of a piece of DNA across several orders of magnitude, generating thousands to millions of copies of a particular DNA sequence. Developed in 1983 by Kary Mullis, PCR is now a common and often indispensable technique used in medical and biological research labs for a variety of applications. These include DNA cloning for sequencing, DNA-based phylogeny, or functional analysis of genes; the diagnosis of hereditary diseases; the identification of genetic fingerprints; and the detection and diagnosis of infectious diseases. In 1993, Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry along with Michael Smith for his work on PCR. The method relies on thermal cycling, consisting of cycles of repeated heating and cooling of the reaction for DNA melting and enzymatic replication of the DNA. Primers (short DNA fragments) containing sequences complementary to the target region along with a DNA polymerase (after which the method is named) are key components to enable selective and repeated amplification. As PCR progresses, the DNA generated is itself used as a template for replication, setting in motion a chain reaction in which the DNA template is exponentially amplified. PCR can be extensively modified to perform a wide array of genetic manipulations. Almost all PCR applications employ a heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally isolated from the bacterium Thermus aquaticus. This DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from DNA building-blocks, the nucleotides, by using single-stranded DNA as a template and DNA oligonucleotides, which are required for initiation of DNA synthesis. The vast majority of PCR methods use thermal cycling, i.e. , alternately heating and cooling the PCR sample to a defined series of temperature steps. These thermal cycling steps are necessary first to physically separate the two strands in a DNA double helix at a high temperature in a process called DNA melting. At a lower temperature, each strand is then used as the template in DNA synthesis by the DNA polymerase to selectively amplify the target DNA. The selectivity of PCR results from the use of primers that are complementary to the DNA region targeted for amplification under specific thermal cycling conditions.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hot_plate_test	Hot plate test	The hot plate test is a test of the pain response in animals, similar to the tail flick test. It is used in basic pain research and in testing the effectiveness of analgesics by observing the reaction to pain caused by heat. It was proposed by Eddy and Leimbach in 1953. They used a behavioral model of nociception where behaviors such as jumping and hind paw-licking are elicited following a noxious thermal stimulus. Licking is a rapid response to painful thermal stimuli that is a direct indicator of nociceptive threshold. Jumping represents a more elaborated response, with a latency, and encompasses an emotional component of escaping.

It is used in basic pain research and to measure the effectiveness of analgesics, by observing the reaction to heat. It was first described by D'Amour and Smith in 1941.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/List_of_purification_methods_in_chemistry	List of purification methods in chemistry	Purification in a chemical context is the physical separation of a chemical substance of interest from foreign or contaminating substances. The following list of chemical purification methods should not be considered exhaustive. Affinity purification is used to purify proteins by retaining them on a column through their affinity to antibodies, enzymes or receptors which have been immobilised on the column. Filtration is a mechanical method to separate solids from liquids or gases by passing the feed stream through a porous sheet such as a cloth or membrane, which retains the solids and allows the liquid to pass through. Centrifugation is a process in which light particles are revolved over high speed with the help of electric motor so that the fine particles which do not settle at bottom would settle down. Evaporation is used to remove volatile liquids from non-volatile solutes which cannot be done through filtration due to the small size of the substances. Solvent extraction removes an impurity, or recovers a desired product, by dissolving it in a solvent in which other components of the feed material are soluble. Crystallization separates a product from a liquid feedstream, often in extremely pure form, by cooling the feedstream or adding precipitants which lower the solubility of the desired product so that it forms crystals. The pure solid crystals are then separated from the remaining liquor by filtration or centrifugation. Recrystallization: In analytical and synthetic chemistry work, purchased reagents of doubtful purity may be recrystallized, e.g. dissolved in a very pure solvent, and then crystallized, and the crystals recovered, in order to improve and/or verify their purity. Adsorption removes a soluble impurity from a feedstream by trapping it on the surface of a solid material such as activated carbon which forms strong noncovalent chemical bonds with the impurity. Chromatography employs adsorption and desorption on a packed bed of a solid to purify multiple components of a single feedstream. Smelting is used to produce metals from raw ore, and involves adding chemicals to the ore and heating it up to the melting point of the metal. Refining is used primarily in the petroleum industry, whereby crude oil is heated and separated into stages according to the condensation points of the various elements. Distillation, widely used in petroleum refining and in purification of ethanol separates volatile liquids on the basis of their relative volatilities. Water purification combines a number of methods to produce potable or drinking water. Downstream processing refers to purification of chemicals, pharmaceuticals and food ingredients produced by fermentation or synthesized by plant and animal tissues, for example antibiotics, citric acid, vitamin E, and insulin. Fractionation refers to a purification strategy in which some relatively inefficient purification method is repeatedly applied to isolate the desired substance in progressively greater purity. Electrolysis refers to the breakdown of substances using an electric current. This removes impurities in a substance that an electric current is run through Sublimation is the process of changing of any substance (usually on heating) from a solid to a gas (or from gas to a solid) without passing through liquid phase. Bioleaching is the extraction of metals from their ores through the use of living organisms.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Real-time_polymerase_chain_reaction	Real-time polymerase chain reaction	"In molecular biology, real-time polymerase chain reaction, also called quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) or kinetic polymerase chain reaction is a laboratory technique based on the PCR, which is used to amplify and simultaneously quantify a targeted DNA molecule. For one or more specific sequences in a DNA sample, Real Time-PCR enables both detection and quantification. The quantity can be either an absolute number of copies or a relative amount when normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes. The procedure follows the general principle of polymerase chain reaction; its key feature is that the amplified DNA is detected as the reaction progresses in real time. This is a new approach compared to standard PCR, where the product of the reaction is detected at its end. Two common methods for detection of products in real-time PCR are: (1) non-specific fluorescent dyes that intercalate with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific DNA probes consisting of oligonucleotides that are labeled with a fluorescent reporter which permits detection only after hybridization of the probe with its complementary DNA target. Frequently, real-time PCR is combined with reverse transcription to quantify messenger RNA and non-coding RNA in cells or tissues. qPCR is the abbreviation used for real-time PCR. Real-time reverse-transcription PCR is often denoted as: qRT-PCR The acronym ""RT-PCR"" commonly denotes reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SuperSAGE	SuperSAGE	"SuperSAGE is the most advanced derivate of the serial analysis of gene expression technology (SAGE) for the analysis of expressed genes in eukaryotic organisms. Like in SAGE, a specific tag from each transcribed gene is recovered. By sequencing and counting as many tags as possible, the transcription profile, stating what gene is described and how often, becomes apparent. SuperSAGE uses the type III-endonuclease EcoP15I of phage P1, to cut 26 bp long sequence tags from each transcript's cDNA, expanding the tag-size by at least 6 bp as compared to the predecessor techniques SAGE and LongSAGE. The longer tag-size allows for a more precise allocation of the tag to the corresponding transcript, because each additional base increases the precision of the annotation considerably. Like in the original SAGE protocol, so-called ditags are formed, using blunt-ended tags. However, SuperSAGE avoids the bias observed during the less random LongSAGE 20 bp ditag-ligation. By direct sequencing with modern high-throughput sequencing techniques, hundred thousands or millions of tags can be analyzed simultaneously, producing very precise and quantitative gene expression profiles. Therefore, tag-based gene expression profiling also called ""digital gene expression profiling"" (DGE) can today provide most accurate transcription profiles that overcome the limitations of microarrays. The 26 bp tags have a number of advantages over the smaller tags: Most notably due to the exact annotation of SuperSAGE tags (at least 10,000 times more accurate than LongSAGE tags), a substantially increased number of transcripts can be differentiated. Many different transcript isoforms can be found. Novel transcripts can be discovered, that escape detection on microarrays. Sense and antisense transcripts and their different regulation can be detected. Due to the exact annotation of the 26 bp tags, two or more interacting organisms (parasite-host, pathogen-host) can be analyzed simultaneously. The 26 bp tags can directly be spotted onto microarrays, and candidate transcripts be combined to produce focused microarrays (i.e. microarrays loaded only with genes, that are relevant for a specific process). The 26 bp tag allows the design of highly specific primers for downstream PCR (like for 3â€™- or 5â€™-RACE) or of specific probes for the identification of clones from a cDNA library. Very precise and comprehensive gene expression profiles of any eukaryotic organism can therefore be established, which in many regards are superior to microarrays. Each and every transcript can be quantified by counting the tags in a SuperSAGE library such that quantitative genetics is readily possible with SuperSAGE."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vivisection	Vivisection	"Vivisection (from Latin vivus, meaning ""alive"", and sectio, meaning ""cutting"") is defined as surgery conducted for experimental purposes on a living organism, typically animals with a central nervous system, to view living internal structure. The term is sometimes more broadly defined as any experimentation on live animals The term is often used by organizations opposed to animal experimentation but is rarely used by practicing scientists. Human vivisection has been perpetrated as a form of torture."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Column_chromatography	Column chromatography	Column chromatography in chemistry is a method used to purify individual chemical compounds from mixtures of compounds. It is often used for preparative applications on scales from micrograms up to kilograms. The main advantage of column chromatography is the relatively low cost and disposability of the stationary phase used in the process. The latter prevents cross-contamination and stationary phase degradation due to recycling. The classical preparative chromatography column, is a glass tube with a diameter from 5Â mm to 50Â mm and a height of 5Â cm to 1 m with a tap and some kind of a filter (a glass frit or glass wool plug â€“ to prevent the loss of the stationary phase) at the bottom. Two methods are generally used to prepare a column: the dry method, and the wet method. For the dry method, the column is first filled with dry stationary phase powder, followed by the addition of mobile phase, which is flushed through the column until it is completely wet, and from this point is never allowed to run dry. For the wet method, a slurry is prepared of the eluent with the stationary phase powder and then carefully poured into the column. Care must be taken to avoid air bubbles. A solution of the organic material is pipetted on top of the stationary phase. This layer is usually topped with a small layer of sand or with cotton or glass wool to protect the shape of the organic layer from the velocity of newly added eluent. Eluent is slowly passed through the column to advance the organic material. Often a spherical eluent reservoir or an eluent-filled and stoppered separating funnel is put on top of the column. The individual components are retained by the stationary phase differently and separate from each other while they are running at different speeds through the column with the eluent. At the end of the column they elute one at a time. During the entire chromatography process the eluent is collected in a series of fractions. The composition of the eluent flow can be monitored and each fraction is analyzed for dissolved compounds, e.g. by analytical chromatography, UV absorption, or fluorescence. Colored compounds (or fluorescent compounds with the aid of an UV lamp) can be seen through the glass wall as moving bands.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oligonucleotide_synthesis	Oligonucleotide synthesis	Oligonucleotide synthesis is the chemical synthesis of relatively short fragments of nucleic acids with defined chemical structure. The technique is extremely useful in current laboratory practice because it provides a rapid and inexpensive access to custom-made oligonucleotides of the desired sequence. Whereas enzymes synthesize DNA and RNA in a 5' to 3' direction, chemical oligonucleotide synthesis is carried out in the opposite, 3' to 5' direction. Currently, the process is implemented as solid-phase synthesis using phosphoramidite method and phosphoramidite building blocks derived from protected 2'-deoxynucleosides, ribonucleosides, or chemically modified nucleosides, e.g. LNA. To obtain the desired oligonucleotide, the building blocks are sequentially coupled to the growing oligonucleotide chain in the order required by the sequence of the product. The process has been fully automated since the late 1970s. Upon the completion of the chain assembly, the product is released from the solid phase to solution, deprotected, and collected. The occurrence of side reactions sets practical limits for the length of synthetic oligonucleotides (up to about 200 nucleotide residues) because the number of errors accumulates with the length of the oligonucleotide being synthesized. Products are often isolated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) to obtain the desired oligonucleotides in high purity. Typically, synthetic oligonucleotides are single-stranded DNA or RNA molecules around 15â€“25 bases in length. Oligonucleotides find a variety of applications in molecular biology and medicine. They are most commonly used as antisense oligonucleotides, small interfering RNA, primers for DNA sequencing and amplification, probes for detecting complementary DNA or RNA via molecular hybridization, tools for the targeted introduction of mutations and restriction sites, and for the synthesis of artificial genes.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fractionation	Fractionation	Fractionation is a separation process in which a certain quantity of a mixture (solid, liquid, solute, suspension or isotope) is divided up in a number of smaller quantities in which the composition varies according to a gradient. Fractions are collected based on differences in a specific property of the individual components. A common trait in fractionations is the need to find an optimum between the amount of fractions collected and the desired purity in each fraction. Fractionation makes it possible to isolate more than two components in a mixture in a single run. This property sets it apart from other separation techniques. Fractionation is widely employed in many branches of science and technology. Mixtures of liquids and gases are separated by fractional distillation by difference in boiling point. Fractionation of components also takes place in column chromatography by a difference in affinity between stationary phase and the mobile phase. In fractional crystallization and fractional freezing, chemical substances are fractionated based on difference in solubility at a given temperature. In cell fractionation, cell components are separated by difference in mass.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunoelectrophoresis	Immunoelectrophoresis	Immunoelectrophoresis is a general name for a number of biochemical methods for separation and characterization of proteins based on electrophoresis and reaction with antibodies. All variants of immunoelectrophoresis require immunoglobulins, also known as antibodies reacting with the proteins to be separated or characterized. The methods were developed and used extensively during the second half of the 20th century. In somewhat chronological order: Immunoelectrophoretic analysis (one-dimensional immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Grabar), crossed immunoelectrophoresis (two-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell), rocket-immunoelectrophoresis (one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Laurell), fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Svendsen and Harboe, affinity immunoelectrophoresis ad modum BÃ¸g-Hansen. Agarose as 1% gel slabs of about 1Â mm thickness buffered at high pH (around 8.6) is traditionally preferred for the electrophoresis as well as the reaction with antibodies. The agarose was chosen as the gel matrix because it has large pores allowing free passage and separation of proteins, but provides an anchor for the immunoprecipitates of protein and specific antibodies. The high pH was chosen because antibodies are practically immobile at high pH. An electrophoresis equipment with a horizontal cooling plate was normally recommended for the electrophoresis. Immunoprecipitates may be seen in the wet agarose gel, but are stained with protein stains like Coomassie Brilliant Blue in the dried gel. In contrast to SDS-gel electrophoresis, the electrophoresis in agarose allows native conditions, preserving the native structure and activities of the proteins under investigation, therefore immunoelectrophoresis allows characterization of enzyme activities and ligand binding etc. in addition to electrophoretic separation. The immunoelectrophoretic analysis ad modum Grabar is the classical method of immunoelectrophoresis. Proteins are separated by electrophoresis, then antibodies are applied in a trough next to the separated proteins and immunoprecipitates are formed after a period of diffusion of the separated proteins and antibodies against each other. The introduction of the immunoelectrophoretic analysis gave a great boost to protein chemistry, some of the very first results were the resolution of proteins in biological fluids and biological extracts. Among the important observations made were the great number of different proteins in serum, the existence of several immunoglobulin classes and their electrophoretic heterogeneity. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis is also called two-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis ad modum Clarke and Freeman or ad modum Laurell. In this method the proteins are first separated during the first dimension electrophoresis, then instead of the diffusion towards the antibodies, the proteins are electrophoresed into an antibody-containing gel in the second dimension. Immunoprecipitation will take place during the second dimension electrophorsis and the immunoprecipitates have a characteristic bell-shape, each precipitate representing one antigen, the position of the precipitate being dependent on the amount of protein as well as the amount of specific antibody in the gel, so relative quantification can be performed. The sensitivity and resolving power of crossed immunoelectrophoresis is than that of the classical immunoelectrophoretic analysis and there are multiple variations of the technique useful for various purposes. Crossed immunoelectrophoresis has been used for studies of proteins in biological fluids, particularly human serum, and biological extracts. Rocket immunoelectrophoresis is one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophoresis. The method had been used for quantitation of human serum proteins before automated methods became available. Fused rocket immunoelectrophoresis is a modification of one-dimensional quantitative immunoelectrophorsis used for detailed measurement of proteins in fractions from protein separation experiments. Affinity immunoelectrophoresis is based on changes in the electrophoretic pattern of proteins through specific interaction or complex formation with other macromolecules or ligands. Affinity immunoelectrophoresis has been used for estimation of binding constants, as for instance with lectins or for characterization of proteins with specific features like glycan content or ligand binding. Some variants of affinity immunoelectrophoresis are similar to affinity chromatography by use of immobilized ligands. The open structure of the immunoprecipitate in the agarose gel will allow additional binding of radioactively labeled antibodies to reveal specific proteins. This variation has been used for identification of allergens through reaction with IgE. Two factors determine that immunoelectrophoretic methods are not widely used. First they are rather work intensive and require some manual expertise. Second they require rather large amounts of polyclonal antibodies. Today gel electrophoresis followed by electroblotting is the preferred method for protein characterization because its ease of operation, its high sensitivity, and its low requirement for specific antibodies. In addition proteins are separated by gel electrophoresis on the basis of their apparent molecular weight, which is not accomplished by immunoelectrophoresis, but nevertheless immunoelectrophoretic methods are still useful when non-reducing conditions are needed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microscopy	Microscopy	Microscopy is the technical field of using microscopes to view samples and objects that cannot be seen with the unaided eye (objects that are not within the resolution range of the normal eye). There are three well-known branches of microscopy: optical, electron, and scanning probe microscopy. Optical and electron microscopy involve the diffraction, reflection, or refraction of electromagnetic radiation/electron beams interacting with the specimen, and the subsequent collection of this scattered radiation or another signal in order to create an image. This process may be carried out by wide-field irradiation of the sample (for example standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy) or by scanning of a fine beam over the sample. Scanning probe microscopy involves the interaction of a scanning probe with the surface of the object of interest. The development of microscopy revolutionized biology and remains an essential technique in the life and physical sciences.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Soxhlet_extractor	Soxhlet extractor	A Soxhlet extractor is a piece of laboratory apparatus invented in 1879 by Franz von Soxhlet. It was originally designed for the extraction of a lipid from a solid material. However, a Soxhlet extractor is not limited to the extraction of lipids. Typically, a Soxhlet extraction is only required where the desired compound has a limited solubility in a solvent, and the impurity is insoluble in that solvent. If the desired compound has a significant solubility in a solvent then a simple filtration can be used to separate the compound from the insoluble substance. Normally a solid material containing some of the desired compound is placed inside a thimble made from thick filter paper, which is loaded into the main chamber of the Soxhlet extractor. The Soxhlet extractor is placed onto a flask containing the extraction solvent. The Soxhlet is then equipped with a condenser. The solvent is heated to reflux. The solvent vapour travels up a distillation arm, and floods into the chamber housing the thimble of solid. The condenser ensures that any solvent vapour cools, and drips back down into the chamber housing the solid material. The chamber containing the solid material slowly fills with warm solvent. Some of the desired compound will then dissolve in the warm solvent. When the Soxhlet chamber is almost full, the chamber is automatically emptied by a siphon side arm, with the solvent running back down to the distillation flask. The thimble ensures that the rapid motion of the solvent does not transport any solid material to the still pot. This cycle may be allowed to repeat many times, over hours or days. During each cycle, a portion of the non-volatile compound dissolves in the solvent. After many cycles the desired compound is concentrated in the distillation flask. The advantage of this system is that instead of many portions of warm solvent being passed through the sample, just one batch of solvent is recycled. After extraction the solvent is removed, typically by means of a rotary evaporator, yielding the extracted compound. The non-soluble portion of the extracted solid remains in the thimble, and is usually discarded.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/QPNC-PAGE	QPNC-PAGE	QPNC-PAGE, or quantitative preparative native continuous polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is a high-resolution technique applied in biochemistry and bioinorganic chemistry to separate proteins by isoelectric point. This variant of gel electrophoresis is used by biologists to isolate active or native metalloproteins in biological samples and to resolve properly and improperly folded metal cofactor-containing proteins or protein isoforms in complex protein mixtures.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allele-specific_oligonucleotide	Allele-specific oligonucleotide	An allele-specific oligonucleotide (ASO) is a short piece of synthetic DNA complementary to the sequence of a variable target DNA. It acts as a probe for the presence of the target in a Southern blot assay or, more commonly, in the simpler Dot blot assay. It is a common tool used in genetic testing, forensics, and Molecular Biology research. An ASO is typically an oligonucleotide of 15â€“21 nucleotide bases in length. It is designed (and used) in a way that makes it specific for only one version, or allele, of the DNA being tested. The length of the ASO, which strand it is chosen from, and the conditions by which it is bound to (and washed from) the target DNA all play a role in its specificity. These probes can usually be designed to detect a difference of as little as 1 base in the target's genetic sequence, a basic ability in the assay of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), important in genotype analysis and the Human Genome Project. To be detected after it has bound to its target, the ASO must be labeled with a radioactive, enzymatic, or fluorescent tag. The Illumina Methylation Assay technology takes advantage of ASO to detect one base pair difference (cytosine versus thymine) to measure methylation at a specific CpG site.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mason%E2%80%93Weaver_equation	Masonâ€“Weaver equation	The Masonâ€“Weaver equation describes the sedimentation and diffusion of solutes under a uniform force, usually a gravitational field. Assuming that the gravitational field is aligned in the z direction (Fig. 1), the Masonâ€“Weaver equation may be written where t is the time, c is the solute concentration (moles per unit length in the z-direction), and the parameters D, s, and g represent the solute diffusion constant, sedimentation coefficient and the (presumed constant) acceleration of gravity, respectively. The Masonâ€“Weaver equation is complemented by the boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the cell, denoted as and, respectively (Fig. 1). These boundary conditions correspond to the physical requirement that no solute pass through the top and bottom of the cell, i.e. , that the flux there be zero. The cell is assumed to be rectangular and aligned with the Cartesian axes (Fig. 1), so that the net flux through the side walls is likewise zero. Hence, the total amount of solute in the cell is conserved, i.e. , .

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Separatory_funnel	Separatory funnel	A separatory funnel, also known as separation funnel, separating funnel, or colloquially sep funnel, is a piece of laboratory glassware used in liquid-liquid extractions to separate (partition) the components of a mixture into two immiscible solvent phases of different densities Typically, one of the phases will be aqueous, and the other a non-polar lipophilic organic solvent such as ether, MTBE, dichloromethane, chloroform, or ethyl acetate. All of these solvents form a clear delineation between the two liquids. The two layers formed are usually known as the organic and aqueous phases. Most organic solvents float on top of an aqueous phase, though important exceptions are most halogenated solvents. The organic solvent used for the extraction must not react with the substance to be extracted or with water. It should also have a low boiling point so it can be easily removed from the product. A separating funnel takes the shape of a cone with a hemispherical end. It has a stopper at the top and stopcock (tap), at the bottom. Separating funnels used in laboratories are typically made from borosilicate glass and their stopcocks are made from glass or PTFE. Typical sizes are between 50Â mL and 3Â L. In industrial chemistry they can be much bigger and for much larger volumes centrifuges are used. The sloping sides are designed to facilitate the identification of the layers. The stopcock-controlled outlet is designed to drain the liquid out of the funnel. On top of the funnel there is a standard taper joint which fits with a ground glass or Teflon stopper. To use a separatory funnel, the two phases and the mixture to be separated in solution are added through the top with the stopcock at the bottom closed. The funnel is then closed and shaken gently by inverting the funnel multiple times; if the two solutions are mixed together too vigorously emulsions will form. The funnel is then inverted and the tap carefully opened to release excess vapor pressure. The separating funnel is set aside to allow for the complete separation of the phases. The top and the bottom tap are then opened and the two phases are released by gravitation. Before using the separatory funnel, make sure it is placed safely in a ring stand. Also place an Erlenmeyer flask below the separatory funnel to ensure that any drops which may leak out of the funnel are caught in the flask. Finally, it is of vital importance to make sure that the stopcock is tightly closed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Toeprinting_assay	Toeprinting assay	The toeprinting assay (originally called extension inhibition assay) is method to look at the interaction of messenger RNA with ribosomes or other RNA-binding proteins. It is different from standard DNA footprinting assay. The toeprinting assay identifies only one edge of the complex on the RNA, whereas DNA footprinting identified both edges of the complex on the DNA. The toeprinting assay has been utilized to examine the formation of the translation initiation complex. The general idea is that you take an RNA of interest and mix it with the 30s subunit of the ribosome, a synthetic DNA primer that hybridizes downstream of the binding site, the four deoxynucleotide triphosphates, and reverse transcriptase (RT). RT will normally synthesize cDNA by extending the primer to the 5' end of the RNA. However, a bound ribosome will block RT from continuing, resulting in a shortened cDNA that is called a toeprint when observed on a sequencing gel. The precise nucleotide position of the toeprint on the RNA can be determined by running a DNA sequencing reaction generated with the same primer in adjacent lanes. 1.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gel_electrophoresis_of_proteins	Gel electrophoresis of proteins	Protein electrophoresis is a method for analysing the proteins in a fluid or an extract. The electrophoresis may be performed with a small volume of sample in a number of alternative ways with or without a supporting medium: SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Each method has many variations with individual advantages and limitations. Gel electrophoresis is often performed in combination with electroblotting immunoblotting to give additional information about a specific protein. Because of practical limitations, protein electrophoresis is generally not suited as a preparative method.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysis_buffer	Lysis buffer	A lysis buffer is a buffer solution used for the purpose of lysing cells for use in molecular biology experiments that analyze the compounds of the cells. There are many different types of lysis buffer that can be applied, depending on what analysis the cell lysate will be used for (e.g. red blood cell lysis buffer). Generally, lysis buffers contain tris-HCl, EDTA, EGTA, SDS, deoxycholate, tritonX and/or NP-40. In some cases the buffer may also contain NaCl. In studies like DNA fingerprinting the lysis buffer is used for DNA isolation. Dish soap can be used in a pinch to break down the cell and nuclear membranes, allowing the DNA to be released. Other such lysis buffers include the proprietary Qiagen product Buffer P2. RIPA buffer is another commonly used lysis buffer for immunoprecipitation and general protein extraction from cells and tissues.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nanopore_sequencing	Nanopore sequencing	Nanopore sequencing is a method under development since 1995 for determining the order in which nucleotides occur on a strand of DNA. A nanopore is simply a small hole, of the order of 1 nanometer in internal diameter. Certain porous transmembrane cellular proteins act as nanopores, and nanopores have also been made by etching a somewhat larger hole (several tens of nanometers) in a piece of silicon, and then gradually filling it in using ion-beam sculpting methods which results in a much smaller diameter hole: the nanopore. Graphene is also being explored as a synthetic substrate for solid-state nanopores. The theory behind nanopore sequencing is that when a nanopore is immersed in a conducting fluid and a potential (voltage) is applied across it, an electric current due to conduction of ions through the nanopore can be observed. The amount of current is very sensitive to the size and shape of the nanopore. If single nucleotides (bases), strands of DNA or other molecules pass through or near the nanopore, this can create a characteristic change in the magnitude of the current through the nanopore.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paired-end_tag	Paired-end tag	"Paired-end tags (PET) (sometimes ""Paired-End diTags"", or simply ""ditags"") are the short sequences at the 5â€™ and 3â€™ ends of a DNA fragment which are unique enough that they (theoretically) exist together only once in a genome, therefore making the sequence of the DNA inbetween them available upon search (if full-genome sequence data is availabe) or upon further sequencing (since tag sites are unique enough to serve as primer annealing sites). Paired-end tags (PET) exist in PET libraries with the intervening DNA absent, that is, a PET ""represents"" a larger fragment of genomic or cDNA by consisting of a short 5' linker sequence, a short 5' sequence tag, a short 3' sequence tag, and a short 3' linker sequence. It was shown conceptually that 13 bp is sufficient to map tags uniquely. However, longer sequences are more practical for mapping reads uniquely. The endonucleases (discussed below) used to produce PETs give longer tags (18/20 bp and 25/27 bp) but sequences of 50â€“100 base pairs would be optimal for both mapping and cost efficiency. After extracting the PETs from many DNA fragments, they are linked (concatenated) together for efficient sequencing. On average, 20â€“30 tags could be sequenced with the Sanger method, which has a longer read length. Since the tag sequences are short, individual PETs are well suited for next-generation sequencing that has short read lengths and higher throughput. The main advantages of PET sequencing are its reduced cost by sequencing only short fragments, detection of structural variants in the genome, and increased specificity when aligning back to the genome compared to single tags, which involves only one end of the DNA fragment."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Digital_holographic_microscopy	Digital holographic microscopy	Digital holographic microscopy (DHM) is digital holography applied to microscopy. Digital holographic microscopy distinguishes itself from other microscopy methods by not recording the projected image of the object. Instead, the light wave front information originating from the object is digitally recorded as a hologram, from which a computer calculates the object image by using a numerical reconstruction algorithm. The image forming lens in traditional microscopy is thus replaced by a computer algorithm. Other closely related microscopy methods to digital holographic microscopy are interferometric microscopy, optical coherence tomography and diffraction phase microscopy. Common to all methods is the use of a reference wave front to obtain amplitude (intensity) and phase information. The information is recorded on a digital image sensor or by a photo detector from which an image of the object is created (reconstructed) by a computer. In traditional microscopy, which do not use a reference wave front, only intensity information is recorded and essential information about the object is lost. Digital holography has mostly been applied to light microscopy. However, digital holography has also been applied to electron microscopy. Holography was invented by Dennis Gabor to improve the electron microscope. For various reasons holography never made it into the electron microscope. Digital electron holography may finally bring home holography to its birthplace and fulfill Gaborâ€™s vision.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liquid%E2%80%93liquid_extraction	Liquidâ€“liquid extraction	Liquidâ€“liquid extraction, also known as solvent extraction and partitioning, is a method to separate compounds based on their relative solubilities in two different immiscible liquids, usually water and an organic solvent. It is an extraction of a substance from one liquid phase into another liquid phase. Liquidâ€“liquid extraction is a basic technique in chemical laboratories, where it is performed using a separatory funnel. This type of process is commonly performed after a chemical reaction as part of the work-up. The term partitioning is commonly used to refer to the underlying chemical and physical processes involved in liquidâ€“liquid extraction but may be fully synonymous. The term solvent extraction can also refer to the separation of a substance from a mixture by preferentially dissolving that substance in a suitable solvent. In that case, a soluble compound is separated from an insoluble compound or a complex matrix. Solvent extraction is used in nuclear reprocessing, ore processing, the production of fine organic compounds, the processing of perfumes, the production of vegetable oils and biodiesel, and other industries. Liquidâ€“liquid extraction is possible in non-aqueous systems: In a system consisting of a molten metal in contact with molten salts, metals can be extracted from one phase to the other. This is related to a mercury electrode where a metal can be reduced, the metal will often then dissolve in the mercury to form an amalgam that modifies its electrochemistry greatly. For example, it is possible for sodium cations to be reduced at a mercury cathode to form sodium amalgam, while at an inert electrode (such as platinum) the sodium cations are not reduced. Instead, water is reduced to hydrogen. A detergent or fine solid can be used to stabilize an emulsion, or third phase.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Surround_Optical_Fiber_Immunoassay	Surround Optical Fiber Immunoassay	Surround optical fiber immunoassay (SOFIA) is an ultrasensitive, in vitro diagnostic platform incorporating a surround optical fiber assembly that captures fluorescence emissions from an entire sample. The technology's defining characteristics are its extremely high limit of detection, sensitivity and dynamic range. SOFIAâ€™s sensitivity is measured at the attogram level (10g), making it approximately one billion times more sensitive than conventional diagnostic techniques. Based on its enhanced dynamic range, SOFIA is able to discriminate levels of analyte in a sample over 10 orders of magnitude facilitating accurate titering. As a diagnostic platform, SOFIA has a broad range of applications. Several studies have already demonstrated SOFIAâ€™s unprecedented ability to detect naturally occurring prions in the blood and urine of disease carriers. This is expected to lead to the first reliable ante mortem screening test for vCJD, BSE, scrapie, CWD, and other transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Given the technologyâ€™s extreme sensitivity, additional unique applications are anticipated, including in vitro tests for other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimerâ€™s and Parkinsonâ€™s. SOFIA was developed as a result of a joint-collaborative research project between Los Alamos National Laboratory and State University of New York, and was supported by the Department of Defense's National Prion Research Program. Its ongoing development is being spearheaded by Bionosis, Inc. , a private-sector biotechnology company.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sedimentation	Sedimentation	Sedimentation is the tendency for particles in suspension to settle out of the fluid in which they are entrained, and come to rest against a barrier. This is due to their motion through the fluid in response to the forces acting on them: these forces can be due to gravity, centrifugal acceleration or electromagnetism. In geology sedimentation is often used as the polar opposite of erosion, i.e. , the terminal end of sediment transport. In that sense it includes the termination of transport by saltation or true bedload transport. Settling is the falling of suspended particles through the liquid, whereas sedimentation is the termination of the settling process. Sedimentation may pertain to objects of various sizes, ranging from large rocks in flowing water to suspensions of dust and pollen particles to cellular suspensions to solutions of single molecules such as proteins and peptides. Even small molecules such as aspirin can be sedimented, although it can be difficult to apply a sufficiently strong force to produce significant sedimentation. The term is typically used in geology, to describe the deposition of sediment which results in the formation of sedimentary rock, and in various chemical and environmental fields to describe the motions of often-smaller particles and molecules. Process is also used in biotech industry to separate out cells from the culture media.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hofmeister_series	Hofmeister series	The Hofmeister series or lyotropic series is a classification of ions in order of their ability to salt out or salt in proteins. The effects of these changes were first worked out by Franz Hofmeister, who studied the effects of cations and anions on the solubility of proteins. Hofmeister discovered a series of salts that have consistent effects on the solubility of proteins and (it was discovered later) on the stability of their secondary and tertiary structure. Anions appear to have a larger effect than cations, and are usually ordered (This is a partial listing; many more salts have been studied. ) The order of cations is usually given as The mechanism of the Hofmeister series is not entirely clear, but does not seem to result from changes in general water structure, instead more specific interactions between ions and proteins and ions and the water molecules directly contacting the proteins may be more important. Early members of the series increase solvent surface tension and decrease the solubility of nonpolar molecules; in effect, they strengthen the hydrophobic interaction. By contrast, later salts in the series increase the solubility of nonpolar molecules and decrease the order in water; in effect, they weaken the hydrophobic effect. The salting out effect is commonly exploited in protein purification through the use of ammonium sulfate precipitation. However, these salts also interact directly with proteins (which are charged and have strong dipole moments) and may even bind specifically (e.g. , phosphate and sulfate binding to ribonuclease A). Ions that have a strong 'salting in' effect such as I and SCN are strong denaturants, because they salt in the peptide group, and thus interact much more strongly with the unfolded form of a protein than with its native form. Consequently, they shift the chemical equilibrium of the unfolding reaction towards unfolded protein.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microscale_thermophoresis	Microscale thermophoresis	Microscale thermophoresis (MST) is a technology for the analysis of biomolecules. Microscale thermophoresis is the directed movement of particles in a microscopic temperature gradient. Any change of the hydration shell of biomolecules due to changes in their structure/conformation results in a relative change of movement along the temperature gradient and is used to determine binding affinities, binding kinetics and activity kinetics. Events such as the phosphorylation of a protein or the binding of small molecules to a target can be monitored. MST allows measurement of interactions directly in solution without the need of immobilization to a surface (immobilization-free technology). Microscale thermophoresis was developed by the NanoTemper Technologies GmbH, a German high tech company with headquarters in Munich.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sarfus	Sarfus	Sarfus is an optical quantitative imaging technique based on the association of: an upright or inverted optical microscope in crossed polarization configuration and specific supporting plates - called surfs - on which the sample to observe is deposited. Sarfus visualization is based on the perfect control of the reflection properties of polarized light on a surf, which leads to increase the axial sensitivity of optical microscope by a factor of around 100 without reducing its lateral resolution. Thus this new technique increases the sensitivity of standard optical microscope to a point that it becomes possible to directly visualize thin films (down to 0.3 nanometer) and isolated nano-objects in real-time but also in air or in water.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Selection_and_amplification_binding_assay	Selection and amplification binding assay	Selection and amplification binding assay (SAAB) is a molecular biology technique developed by T. Keith Blackwell and Harold Weintraub in 1990. Its major use is to find the DNA binding site for proteins. Experimental details SAAB experimental procedure consists of several steps, depending upon the knowledge available about the binding site. A typical SAAB consists of the following steps I. Synthesis of template with random sequence in binding site Three situations are possible: (i) when both the binding site and the protein are known and available; (ii) when only a consensus binding site is available and the binding protein is not; and (iii) when the protein is available, but the binding site is unknown. When the binding site is not known, the number of random nucleotide positions in the template must be large II. Incubate labeled double stranded template with protein Usually the protein has to synthesis in a host cell with fusion techniques. Longer incubation time and large quantity are provided in case of unspecific binding site. III. Isolate the DNA bound protein by EMSA The DNA bound protein, migrated in aralamide gel is isolated by autoradiography as per Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) protocol. IV. Amplify the bound template by PCR. For positive control, amplify the starting template also The bound DNA is isolated via gel excision and purified, and amplified using PCR. V. Label amplified binding site and reselect for binding by EMSA (Usually 5 times) Precede the binding step at least for 5 times with the amplified labeled DNA sample and fusion protein. VI. Sequence the DNA After final step of selection and electrophoresis, clone the DNA into some cloning vector and sequence it. Originally Blackwell used Pyro sequencing, which can be replaced by modern techniques. Identification of Quox_1 Homeodomain DNA Binding Sequence Using SAAB (A descriptive example from resent study)-An example Quox1 is a novel homeobox gene (A homeobox is a DNA sequence found within genes that are involved in the regulation of patterns of development in animals, fungi and plants, originally isolated from cDNA library of five week quail embryo. It is the only gene in the hox family that has been found to express in both prosencephalon and mesencephalon involved in the differentiation of the central and peripheral nerve cells. The optimal DNA binding site for Quox1 or its mammalian homologs was identified by SAAB in 2004. Quox1 homeobox sequence was obtained by PCR amplification from a human embryo cDNA library by standard procedure. The amplified DNA fragment was digested with EcoRV and XhoI and cloned into the SmaI and XhoI restriction site of the expression vector pGEMEXxBal. The recombinant plasmids were transformed into competent Escherichia coli strain BL21 and Quox1 fusion proteins were isolated by chromatographic techniques. The radio labeled probe was incubated with 25 pmol of purified Quox1 homeodomain fusion protein in binding buffer for EMSA. The protein bound DNA was detected by autoradiography, and the bands representing proteinâ€“DNA complexes were excised from the gel and the eluted DNA were amplified by PCR using primers complementary to the 20 bp nonrandom flanking sequences. After 5 set of the same procedure,the purified DNA was cloned into pMD 18T and sequenced. Finally the sequence CAATC was identified as the consensus binding sequence for Quox1 homeodomain. Applications of the SAAB By combining the power of random-sequence selection with pooled sequencing, the SAAB imprint assay makes possible simultaneous screening of a large number of binding site mutants. SAAB also allows the identification of sites with high relative binding affinity since the competition is inherent in the protocol. It can also identify site positions that are neutral or specific bases that can interfere with binding, such as a T at - 4 in the E47 half-site. We can apply the technique to less affinity binding sequence also, provided to keep high concentration of binding protein at each step of binding. It is also possible to identify the binding site even if both the protein and sequence is not known.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Slice_preparation	Slice preparation	The slice preparation or brain slice is a laboratory technique in electrophysiology that allows the study of a synapse or neural circuit in isolation from the rest of the brain, in controlled physiological conditions. It involves stimulating and/or recording from a slice of brain tissue immersed in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. The technique allows for greater experimental control, through elimination of the effects of the rest of the brain on the circuit of interest, careful control of the physiological conditions through perfusion of substrates through the incubation fluid, to precise manipulation of neurotransmitter activity through perfusion of agonists and antagonists. However, the increase in control comes with a decrease in the ease with which the results can be applied to the whole neural system.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Relative_fluorescence_units	Relative fluorescence units	"The terms ""relative fluorescence units"" (RFU) and ""RFU peak"" refer to measurements in electrophoresis methods, such as for DNA analysis. A ""relative fluorescence unit"" is a unit of measurement used in analysis which employs fluorescence detection. Fluorescence is detected using a charged coupled device (CCD) array, when the labeled fragments, which are separated within a capillary by using electrophoresis, are energized by laser light and travel across the detection window. A computer program measures the results, determining the quantity or size of the fragments, at each data point, from the level of fluorescence intensity. Samples which contain higher quantities of amplified DNA will have higher corresponding RFU values. An ""RFU peak"" is a relative maximum point along a graph of the analyzed data. The data can be normalized to DNA input or additional normalizing genes. The RFU heights can range from 0 to 2000 or more."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Assay	Assay	An assay is an investigative (analytic) procedure in laboratory medicine, pharmacology, environmental biology, and molecular biology for qualitatively assessing or quantitatively measuring the presence or amount or the functional activity of a target entity (the analyte), which can be a drug or biochemical substance or a cell in an organism or organic sample. The measured entity is generally called the analyte, or the measurand or the target of the assay. The assay usually aims to measure an intensive property of the analyte and express it in the relevant measurement unit (e.g. molarity, density, functional activity in enzyme international units, degree of some effect in comparison to a standard, etc.). If the assay involves addition of exogenous reactants (the reagents), their quantities are kept fixed (or in excess) so that the quantity (and quality) of the target is the only limiting factor for the reaction/assay process, and the difference in the assay outcome is used to deduce the unknown quality or quantity of the target in question. Some assays (e.g. , biochemical assays) may be similar to or have overlap with chemical analysis and titration. But generally, assays involve biological material or phenomena which tend to be intrinsically more complex either in composition or in behavior or both. Thus reading of an assay may be quite noisy and may involve greater difficulties in interpretation than an accurate chemical titration. On the other hand, older generation qualitative assays, especially bioassays, may be much more gross and less quantitative (e.g. , counting death or dysfunction of an organism or cells in a population, or some descriptive change in some body part of a group of animals). In modern practice, assays have become a routine part of medical, environmental, pharmaceutical, forensic and many other businesses at various scales from industrial to curbside or field level. Those assays that have very high commercial demand have been well investigated in research and development sectors of professional industries and have gone through various generations of development of better and sophisticated assays that have become copyrighted intellectual properties through highly competitive process patenting. These kind of industrial scale assays are often done in well equipped laboratories and use high level of automation in organizing the procedure, right from ordering of an assay, to pre-analytic sample processing (sample collection, necessary manipulations e.g. spinning for separation or other processes, aliquoting if necessary, storage, retrieval, pipetting/aspiration etc. ) and are generally tested in high thruput AutoAnalyzers and the results are verified, and transmitted automatically back to the ordering service providers and the end users. These are made possible through use of advanced Laboratory informatics system that interfaces with multiple computer terminals with end users as well as central servers and the physical autoanalyser instruments and other automata.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Viability_assay	Viability assay	A viability assay is an assay to determine the ability of cells or tissues to maintain or recover its viability. For example, examining the ratio of potassium to sodium in cells indicates viability. If the cells do not have high intracellular potassium and low intracellular sodium, then (1) the cell membrane may not be intact, and/or (2) the sodium-potassium pump may not be operating well As with many kinds of viability assays, quantitative measures of physiological function do not indicate whether damage repair and recovery is possible. An assay of the ability of a cell line to adhere and divide may be more indicative of incipient damage than membrane integrity. Fluorescent-based assays do not require large sample sizes. Viability assays are used to assess the success of cryopreservation techniques, the toxicity of substances, or the effectiveness of substances in mitigating effects of toxic substances.

Fluorescence microscopy can be used to find out where the fluorescent probe is bound to the chromosomes. FISH is often used for finding specific features in DNA for use in genetic counseling, medicine, and species identification. FISH can also be used to detect and localize specific RNA targets in cells, circulating tumor cells, and tissue samples. In this context, it can help define the spatial-temporal patterns of gene expression within cells and tissues.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Murashige_and_Skoog_medium	Murashige and Skoog medium	Murashige and Skoog medium or (MSO or MS0) is a plant growth medium used in the laboratories for cultivation of plant cell culture. MSO was invented by plant scientists Toshio Murashige and Folke K. Skoog in 1962 during Murashige's search for a new plant growth regulator. Along with its modifications, it is the most commonly used medium in plant tissue culture experiments in laboratorium. As Skoog's doctoral student, Murashige originally set out to find an as-yet undiscovered growth hormone present in tobacco juice. No such component was discovered; instead, analysis of juiced tobacco and ashed tobacco revealed higher concentrations of specific minerals in plant tissues than were previously known. A series of experiments demonstrated that varying the levels of these nutrients enhanced growth substantially over existing formulations. It was determined that nitrogen in particular enhanced growth of tobacco in tissue culture.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lamm_equation	Lamm equation	The Lamm equation describes the sedimentation and diffusion of a solute under ultracentrifugation in traditional sector-shaped cells. (Cells of other shapes require much more complex equations. ) It was named after Ole Lamm, later professor of physical chemistry at the Royal Institute of Technology, who derived it during his Ph.D. studies under Svedberg at Uppsala University. The Lamm equation can be written: where c is the solute concentration, t and r are the time and radius, and the parameters D, s, and Ï‰ represent the solute diffusion constant, sedimentation coefficient and the rotor angular velocity, respectively. The first and second terms on the right-hand side of the Lamm equation are proportional to D and sÏ‰, respectively, and describe the competing processes of diffusion and sedimentation. Whereas sedimentation seeks to concentrate the solute near the outer radius of the cell, diffusion seeks to equalize the solute concentration throughout the cell. The diffusion constant D can be estimated from the hydrodynamic radius and shape of the solute, whereas the buoyant mass mb can be determined from the ratio of s and D where kBT is the thermal energy, i.e. , Boltzmann's constant kB multiplied by the temperature T in kelvins. Solute molecules cannot pass through the inner and outer walls of the cell, resulting in the boundary conditions on the Lamm equation at the inner and outer radii, ra and rb, respectively. By spinning samples at constant angular velocity Ï‰ and observing the variation in the concentration c(r,Â t), one may estimate the parameters s and D and, thence, the (effective or equivalent) buoyant mass the solute.

It is similar to friability testing, but they are not the same thing. Tablet hardness testers first appeared in the 1930s. In the 1950s, the Strong-Cobb tester was introduced. It was patented by Robert Albrecht on July 21, 1953. and used an air pump. The tablet breaking force was based on arbitrary units referred to as Strong-Cobbs. The new one gave readings that were inconsistent to those given by the older testers. Later, electro-mechanical testing machines were introduced. They often include things like motor drives, and the ability to send measurements to a computer or printer. There are 2 main processes to test tablet hardness: compression testing and 3 point bend testing. For compression testing, the analyst generally aligns the tablet in a repeatable way, and the tablet is squeezed by 2 jaws. The first machines continually applied force with a spring and screw thread until the tablet started to break. When the tablet fractured, the hardness was read with a sliding scale."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sequencing_by_hybridization	Sequencing by hybridization	Sequencing by hybridization is a class of methods for determining the order in which nucleotides occur on a strand of DNA. Typically used for looking for small changes relative to a known DNA sequence. The binding of one strand of DNA to its complementary strand in the DNA double-helix (aka hybridization) is sensitive to even single-base mismatches when the hybrid region is short or if specialized mismatch detection proteins are present. This is exploited in a variety of ways, most notable via DNA chips or microarrays with thousands to billions of synthetic oligonucleotides found in a genome of interest plus many known variations or even all possible single-base variations. The type of sequencing by hybridization described above has largely been displaced by other methods, including sequencing by synthesis, and sequencing by ligation (as well as pore-based methods). However hybridization of oligonucleotides is still used in some sequencing schemes, including hybridization-assisted pore-based sequencing, and reversible hybridization.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Immunohistochemistry	Immunohistochemistry	"Immunohistochemistry or IHC refers to the process of detecting antigens (e.g. , proteins) in cells of a tissue section by exploiting the principle of antibodies binding specifically to antigens in biological tissues. IHC takes its name from the roots ""immuno,"" in reference to antibodies used in the procedure, and ""histo,"" meaning tissue. Immunohistochemical staining is widely used in the diagnosis of abnormal cells such as those found in cancerous tumors. A video showing preparation for immunohistochemistry (8 minutes) and then 20 minutes scanning through immunohistochemically stained tissues near colon cancers, shows different degrees of deficiency in three DNA repair proteins and one mitochondrial protein. Specific molecular markers are characteristic of particular cellular events such as proliferation or cell death. IHC is also widely used in basic research to understand the distribution and localization of biomarkers and differentially expressed proteins in different parts of a biological tissue. Visualising an antibody-antigen interaction can be accomplished in a number of ways.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thin_layer_chromatography	Thin layer chromatography	"Thin layer chromatography (TLC) is a chromatography technique used to separate mixtures. Thin layer chromatography is performed on a sheet of glass, plastic, or aluminium foil, which is coated with a thin layer of adsorbent material, usually silica gel, aluminium oxide, or cellulose. This layer of adsorbent is known as the stationary phase. After the sample has been applied on the plate, a solvent or solvent mixture (known as the mobile phase) is drawn up the plate via capillary action. Because different analytes ascend the TLC plate at different rates, separation is achieved. Thin layer chromatography can be used to monitor the progress of a reaction, identify compounds present in a given mixture, and determine the purity of a substance. Specific examples of these applications include: analyzing ceramides and fatty acids, detection of pesticides or insecticides in food and water, analyzing the dye composition of fibers in forensics, assaying the radiochemical purity of radiopharmaceuticals, or identification of medicinal plants and their constituents A number of enhancements can be made to the original method to automate the different steps, to increase the resolution achieved with TLC and to allow more accurate quantization. This method is referred to as HPTLC, or ""high performance TLC""."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Touchdown_polymerase_chain_reaction	Touchdown polymerase chain reaction	"Touchdown polymerase chain reaction or touchdown style polymerase chain reaction is a method of polymerase chain reaction by which primers will avoid amplifying nonspecific sequences. The annealing temperature during a polymerase chain reaction determines the specificity of primer annealing. The melting point of the primer sets the upper limit on annealing temperature. At temperatures just below this point, only very specific base pairing between the primer and the template will occur. At lower temperatures, the primers bind less specifically. Nonspecific primer binding obscures polymerase chain reaction results, as the nonspecific sequences to which primers anneal in early steps of amplification will ""swamp out"" any specific sequences because of the exponential nature of polymerase amplification. The earliest steps of a touchdown polymerase chain reaction cycle have high annealing temperatures. The annealing temperature is decreased in increments for every subsequent set of cycles (the number of individual cycles and increments of temperature decrease is chosen by the experimenter). The primer will anneal at the highest temperature which is least-permissive of nonspecific binding that it is able to tolerate. Thus, the first sequence amplified is the one between the regions of greatest primer specificity; it is most likely that this is the sequence of interest. These fragments will be further amplified during subsequent rounds at lower temperatures, and will out compete the nonspecific sequences to which the primers may bind at those lower temperatures. If the primer initially (during the higher-temperature phases) binds to the sequence of interest, subsequent rounds of polymerase chain reaction can be performed upon the product to further amplify those fragments. Touchdown increases specificity of the reaction at higher temperatures and increases the efficiency towards the end by lowering the anealing temperature."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nucleic_acid_templated_chemistry	Nucleic acid templated chemistry	Nucleic acid templated chemistry (NATC), or DNA-templated chemistry, is principally a new tool to synthesize chemical compounds. The main advantage of the NAT-chemistry (NATC) is performing of the chemical reaction as an intramolecular reaction. The two oligonucleotides or their analogues are linked via chemical groups to precursors of chemical compounds. The oligonucleotides recognize specific nucleic acids and are hybridized sterically close to each other. Afterwards the chemical active groups interact with each other to combine the precursors into a completely new chemical compound. NATC is usually used to perform the synthesis of complex compounds without need to protect chemically active groups during the synthesis. In 1999 Pavel Sergeev suggested to use NATC to synthesize biologically active compounds within living organisms. The main idea is to use NATC to synthesize specific biologically active compounds within human cells. The precursors are distributed in the whole human body and the chemical reactions are performed only within cells having specific RNA molecules. This approach allows very specific synthesis within peculiar tissues or within specific cells of the tissue. It is especially a new tool to deliver medications to cancer cells. Additionally biologically active compounds could be delivered to specific cells within humans to promote the targeted cells to divisions. NATC also opens the possibility to treat bacterial diseases. Many scientific groups performed NATC in vivo to visualize eucaryotic as well as bacterial cells. As a principle it opens new perspectives to treat oncological and bacterial diseases as well as to visualize them.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capillary_electrochromatography	Capillary electrochromatography	Capillary electrochromatography (CEC) is a chromatographic technique in which the mobile phase is driven through the chromatographic bed by electroosmosis. Capillary electrochromatography is a combination of two analytical techniques, High performance liquid chromatography and capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis aims to separate analytes on the basis of their mass to charge ratio by passing a high voltage across ends of a capillary tube, which is filled with the analyte. High performance liquid chromatography separates analytes by passing them, under high pressure, through a column filled with stationary phase. The interactions between the analytes and the stationary phase and mobile phase lead to the separation of the analytes. In capillary electrochromatography capillaries, packed with HPLC stationary phase, are subjected to a high voltage. Separation is achieved by electrophoretic migration of solutes and differential partitioning.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quantitative_phase_contrast_microscopy	Quantitative phase contrast microscopy	Quantitative phase contrast microscopy, quantitative phase microscopy or just phase microscopy are the collective names for a group of microscopy methods which quantifies the phase shift that occurs when light waves passes through a more optically dense object. Translucent objects, like a living human cell, absorb or scatter small amounts of light. This makes translucent objects difficult to observe in ordinary light microscopes. Such objects do, however, induce a phase shift that can be observed using either a Zernike or a Nomarski phase contrast microscope. Unfortunately, both microscopy methods visualize phase shifts by transforming phase shift gradients into intensity variations. These intensity variations are mixed with other intensity variations, making it difficult to extract quantitative information from conventional phase contrast microscopy images. The principal methods for measuring and visualizing phase shifts include ptychography and various types of holographic microscopy methods such as digital holographic microscopy, holographic interference microscopy and digital in-line holographic microscopy. Common to these methods is that an interference pattern is recoded by a digital image sensor. From the recorded interference pattern, a so called phase shift image or phase image is numerically created by a computer algorithm. Conventional phase contrast microscopy is primarily used to observed unstained living cells. Contrary to conventional phase contrast images, phase shift images of living cells are suitable to be processed by image analysis software. This has led to the development of non-invasive live cell imaging and automated cell culture analysis systems based on quantitative phase contrast microscopy.

Since then, several microscopy methods has been developed which allow researchers to study living cells in greater detail with less effort. <div class=""thumb tright"" style=""width: px; ""> 200px Video 1: Phase contrast microscopy time-lapse video of dividing rattle grasshopper spermatocytes.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jumping_library	Jumping library	Jumping libraries or junction-fragment libraries are collections of genomic DNA fragments generated by chromosome jumping. These libraries allow us to analyze large areas of the genome and overcome distance limitations in common cloning techniques. A jumping library clone is composed of two stretches of DNA that are usually located many kilobases away from each other. The stretch of DNA located between these two â€œendsâ€ﾝ is deleted by a series of biochemical manipulations carried out at the start of this cloning technique.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Macrograph	Macrograph	A macrograph, or a photomacrograph, is an image taken at a scale that is visible to the naked eye, as opposed to a micrographic image. It is sometimes defined more precisely as an image at a scale of less than ten times magnification.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solvent_impregnated_resin	Solvent impregnated resin	Solvent impregnated resins (SIRs) are commercially available (macro)porous resins impregnated with a solvent/an extractant. In this approach, a liquid extractant is contained within the pores of (adsorption) particles. Usually, the extractant is an organic liquid. Its purpose is to extract one or more dissolved components from a surrounding aqueous environment. The basic principle combines adsorption, chromatography and liquid-liquid extraction.
