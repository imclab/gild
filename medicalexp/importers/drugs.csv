http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alprazolam	Alprazolam	2118	DB00404	YU55MQ3IZY	28981-97-7		Oral	Hepatic, via Cytochrome P450 3A4	Alprazolam /Ã¦lËˆprÃ¦zÉ™lÃ¦m/ (trade name Xanax, available among other generic names) is a short-acting anxiolytic of the benzodiazepine class of psychoactive drugs. Alprazolam, like other benzodiazepines, binds to specific sites on the GABAA gamma-amino-butyric acid receptor. Alprazolam is commonly used and FDA approved for the medical treatment of panic disorder, and anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) or social anxiety disorder (SAD). Alprazolam is available for oral administration in compressed tablet (CT) and extended-release capsule (XR) formulations. Alprazolam possesses anxiolytic, sedative, hypnotic, skeletal muscle relaxant, anticonvulsant, and amnestic properties. Alprazolam has a fast onset of action and symptomatic relief. Ninety percent of peak benefits are achieved within the first hour (although onset may begin at 8â€“25 minutes of ingestion) of using either preparation for panic disorder, and full peak benefits are achieved in 1.5 and 1.6 hours respectively. Peak benefits achieved for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) may take up to a week. Tolerance to the anxiolytic/antipanic effects is controversial with some authoritative sources reporting the development of tolerance, and others reporting no development of tolerance; tolerance will however, develop to the sedative effects within a couple of days. Withdrawal symptoms or rebound symptoms may occur after ceasing treatment abruptly following a few weeks or longer of steady dosing, and may necessitate a gradual dose reduction. Alprazolam is the most prescribed and the most misused benzodiazepine on the U.S. retail market. The potential for abuse among those taking it for medical reasons is controversial with some expert reviews stating that the risk is low and similar to that of other benzodiazepine drugs and others stating that there is a substantial risk of abuse and dependence in both patients and non-medical users of alprazolam and that the pharmacological properties of alprazolam, high affinity binding, high potency, having a short elimination half-life as well as a rapid onset of action increase the abuse potential of alprazolam. Compared to the large number of prescriptions, relatively few individuals increase their dose on their own initiative or engage in drug-seeking behavior. Alprazolam is classified as a schedule IV controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amantadine	Amantadine	2130	DB00915	BF4C9Z1J53	768-94-5		oral	negligible	Amantadine (trade name Symmetrel, by Endo Pharmaceuticals) is a drug that has US Food and Drug Administration approval for use both as an antiviral and an antiparkinsonian drug. It is the organic compound 1-adamantylamine or 1-aminoadamantane, meaning it consists of an adamantane backbone that has an amino group substituted at one of the four methyne positions. Rimantadine is a closely related derivative of adamantane with similar biological properties. Apart from medical uses, this compound is useful as a building block, allowing the insertion of an adamantyl group. According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 100% of seasonal H3N2 and 2009 pandemic flu samples tested have shown resistance to adamantanes, and amantadine is no longer recommended for treatment of influenza in the United States. Additionally, its effectiveness as an antiparkinsonian drug is controversial, with a 2003 Cochrane Review concluding that it was ineffective for this purpose.

Carfentanil or carfentanyl (R-33799) is an analogue of the popular synthetic opioid analgesic fentanyl, and is one of the most potent opioids known (also the most potent opioid used commercially). Carfentanil was first synthesized in 1974 by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica which included Paul Janssen. It has a quantitative potency approximately 10,000 times that of morphine and 100 times that of fentanyl, with activity in humans starting at about 1 microgram. It is marketed under the trade name Wildnil as a general anaesthetic agent for large animals. Carfentanil is intended for animal use only as its extreme potency makes it inappropriate for use in humans. Currently sufentanil, approximately 10â€“20 times less potent (500 to 1000 times the efficacy of morphine per weight) than carfentanil, is the maximum strength fentanyl analog for use in humans.

Other names such as Ravotril, Rivatril, Rivotril, Clonex, Paxam, Petril or Kriadex are known throughout the rest of the world. Clonazepam has an unusually long elimination half-life of 18â€“50 hours, making it generally considered to be among the long-acting benzodiazepines. Clonazepam is a chlorinated derivative of nitrazepam and therefore a chloro-nitrobenzodiazepine. Clonazepam has an intermediate onset of action, with a peak blood levels occurring one to four hours after oral administration. It has high effectiveness rate and low toxicity in overdose but, as most medications, it may have drawbacks due to adverse reactions including paradoxical effects and drowsiness. Other long-term effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, which occurs in a third of people treated with clonazepam for longer than four weeks. Clonazepam is classified as a high potency benzodiazepine. The use of clonazepam in long term treatment is inhibited by its ability to induce tolerance to the anticonvulsant effects. However, in a study of patients with epilepsy, the medication could be withdrawn successfully in most patients. In some patients seizures control was reduced after withdrawal, but reintroduction of Clonazepam rapidly resulted in control of the epilepsy. No significant change in cognitive function, mood or behaviour was noted in the patients who discontinued CZP. The benzodiazepine clorazepate may be an alternative to clonazepam due to a slow onset of tolerance and availability in slow-release formulation to counter fluctuations in blood levels. The pharmacological property of clonazepam as with other benzodiazepines is the enhancement of the neurotransmitter GABA via modulation of the GABAA receptor.

The first of the atypical antipsychotics to be developed, it was first introduced in Europe in 1971, but was voluntarily withdrawn by the manufacturer in 1975 after it was shown to cause agranulocytosis, a condition involving a dangerous decrease in the number of white blood cells, that led to death in some patients. In 1989 after studies demonstrated that it was effective in treating treatment-resistant schizophrenia the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of clozapine solely for that use, requiring regular white blood cell and absolute neutrophil counts. The FDA also requires clozapine to carry five black box warnings for agranulocytosis, seizures, myocarditis, for ""other adverse cardiovascular and respiratory effects"", and for ""increased mortality in elderly patients with dementia-related psychosis. "" In 2002 the FDA approved clozapine for reducing the risk of suicidal behavior for patients with schizophrenia. Clozapine is usually used as a last resort in patients that have not responded to other anti-psychotic treatments due to its danger of causing agranulocytosis as well as the costs of having to have blood tests continually during treatment. It is, however, one of the very effective anti-psychotic treatment choices. Patients are monitored weekly for the first six months. If there are no low counts the patient can be monitored every two weeks for an additional six months. Afterwards, the patient may qualify for every four-week monitoring. Clozapine has numerous severe side effects including agranulocytosis, bowel infarction, and seizures, and has been associated with myocarditis and diabetes though those relationships have not been confirmed. Additionally, it also often causes less serious side effects such as hypersalivation and weight gain."

It is one of the active ingredients in many over-the-counter cold and cough medicines, such as Mucinex DM, Robitussin, NyQuil, Dimetapp, Vicks, Coricidin, Delsym, TheraFlu, and others, including generic labels. Dextromethorphan has also found other uses in medicine, ranging from pain relief to psychological applications. It is sold in syrup, tablet, spray, and lozenge forms. In its pure form, dextromethorphan occurs as a white powder. DXM is also used recreationally. When exceeding label-specified maximum dosages, dextromethorphan acts as a dissociative hallucinogen. Its mechanism of action is via multiple effects, including actions as a nonselective serotonin reuptake inhibitor and a sigma-1 receptor agonist. The major metabolite of DXM, dextrorphan, also acts as an NMDA receptor antagonist. In high doses this produces effects similar to, yet distinct from, the dissociative states created by other hallucinogens such as ketamine and phencyclidine. As well, the metabolite 3-methoxymorphinan of dextrorphan (thus a second-level metabolite of DXM) produces local anesthetic effects in rats with potency above dextrorphan, but below that of DXM.

ACE converts the peptide hormone angiotensin I to angiotensin II. One of the actions of angiotensin II is the vasoconstriction of blood vessels resulting in an increase in blood pressure. ACE inhibitors such as enalapril prevent this effect. Enalapril has been shown to lower the death rate in systolic heart failure. Enalapril was the first member of the group known as the dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitors.

It is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. When administered in conjunction with dopaminergic agents such as L-DOPA, entacapone prevents COMT from metabolizing L-DOPA into 3-methoxy-4-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine (3-OMD) in the periphery, which does not easily cross the blood brain barrier (BBB). Pharmacologically, entacapone is somewhat similar to carbidopa or benserazide, in that it is an inhibitor of an enzyme that converts L-DOPA into a compound that cannot cross the blood brain barrier. Carbidopa and benserazide inhibit aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, which converts L-DOPA into dopamine, which cannot cross the blood brain barrier. Entacapone is a member of the class of drugs known as nitrocatechols.

Ephedrine is similar in molecular structure to the well-known drugs phenylpropanolamine and methamphetamine, as well as to the important neurotransmitter epinephrine (adrenalin). Chemically, it is an alkaloid with a phenethylamine skeleton found in various plants in the genus Ephedra. It works mainly by increasing the activity of norepinephrine (noradrenalin) on adrenergic receptors. It is most usually marketed as the hydrochloride or sulfate salt. The herb mÃ¡ huÃ¡ng, used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), contains ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as its principal active constituents.

It can be used in combination with other medications to treat breast cancer in patients who have had surgery to remove the tumor. It is marketed by Pfizer under the trade name Ellence in the US and Pharmorubicin or Epirubicin Ebewe elsewhere. Similarly to other anthracyclines, epirubicin acts by intercalating DNA strands. Intercalation results in complex formation which inhibits DNA and RNA synthesis. It also triggers DNA cleavage by topoisomerase II, resulting in mechanisms that lead to cell death. Binding to cell membranes and plasma proteins may be involved in the compound's cytotoxic effects. Epirubicin also generates free radicals that cause cell and DNA damage. Epirubicin is favoured over doxorubicin, the most popular anthracycline, in some chemotherapy regimens as it appears to cause fewer side-effects. Epirubicin has a different spatial orientation of the hydroxyl group at the 4' carbon of the sugar - it has the opposite chirality - which may account for its faster elimination and reduced toxicity. Epirubicin is primarily used against breast and ovarian cancer, gastric cancer, lung cancer and lymphomas.

It is used medicinally for treatment of acute migraine attacks (sometimes in combination with caffeine). Medicinal usage of ergot fungus began in the 16th century to induce childbirth, yet dosage uncertainties discouraged the use. It has been used to prevent post-partum haemorrhage (bleeding after childbirth). It was first isolated from the ergot fungus by Arthur Stoll at Sandoz in 1918 and marketed as Gynergen in 1921.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estradiol	Estradiol	5757	DB00783	4TI98Z838E	50-28-2		Oral, transdermal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Estradiol (E2 or 17Î²-estradiol, also oestradiol) is a sex hormone. Estradiol is abbreviated E2 as it has two hydroxyl groups in its molecular structure. Estrone has one (E1) and estriol has three (E3). Estradiol is about 10 times as potent as estrone and about 80 times as potent as estriol in its estrogenic effect. Except during the early follicular phase of the menstrual cycle, its serum levels are somewhat higher than that of estrone during the reproductive years of the human female. Thus it is the predominant estrogen during reproductive years both in terms of absolute serum levels as well as in terms of estrogenic activity. During menopause, estrone is the predominant circulating estrogen and during pregnancy estriol is the predominant circulating estrogen in terms of serum levels. Estradiol is also present in males, being produced as an active metabolic product of testosterone. The serum levels of estradiol in males (14 - 55 pg/mL) are roughly comparable to those of postmenopausal women (< 35 pg/mL). Estradiol in vivo is interconvertible with estrone; estradiol to estrone conversion being favored. Estradiol has not only a critical impact on reproductive and sexual functioning, but also affects other organs, including the bones.

Currently it is approved in more than 70 countries worldwide but not in the US, where the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires additional safety and efficacy data for etoricoxib before it will issue approval. Current therapeutic indications are: treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, osteoarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic low back pain, acute pain and gout. Note that approved indications differ by country. Like any other COX-2 selective inhibitor (""coxib""), etoricoxib selectively inhibits isoform 2 of the enzyme cyclo-oxigenase. This reduces the generation of prostaglandins (PGs) from arachidonic acid. Among the different functions exerted by PGs, their role in the inflammation cascade should be highlighted. COX-2 selective inhibitors showed less marked activity on type 1 cycloxigenase compared to traditional non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). This reduced activity is the cause of reduced gastrointestinal side effects, as demonstrated in several large clinical trials performed with different coxibs. Some clinical trials and meta-analysis showed that treatment with some coxibs led to increased incidence of adverse cardiovascular events compared to placebo. Because of these results, some drugs were withdrawn from the market (rofecoxib, in September 2004 and valdecoxib in April 2005). In addition, the FDA and EMA (USA and European Community health authorities respectively) started a revision process of the entire class of both NSAID and COX-2 inhibitors. The FDA concluded its revision on April 6, 2005: the final document can be found here. The EMA concluded its revision on June 27, 2005: the final document can be found here. On April 27, 2007, the Food and Drug Administration issued Merck a ""non-approvable letter"" for etoricoxib. The letter said Merck needs to provide more test results showing that the drug's benefits outweigh its risks before it has another chance of getting approved."

Studies of usage in modern medicine began in the Soviet Union in the 1950s. The active ingredient was extracted, identified, and studied, in particular in relation to its acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting properties. The bulk of the work was carried out by Soviet pharmacologists Mashkovsky and Kruglikova-Lvova, beginning in 1951. The work of Mashkovsky and Kruglikova-Lvova was the first published work that demonstrated the AChE-inhibiting properties of galantamine. The first industrial process was developed in Bulgaria by prof. Paskov in 1959 from a species traditionally used as a popular medicine in Eastern Europe, and, thus, the idea for developing a medicine from these species seems to be based on the local use (i.e. , an ethnobotany-driven drug discovery). Galantamine has been used for decades in Eastern Europe and Russia for various indications such as treatment of myasthenia, myopathy, and sensory and motor dysfunction associated with disorders of the central nervous system. In the US, it is FDA approved for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It is available in both a prescription form and as an over the counter supplement.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desflurane	Desflurane	42113	DB01189	CRS35BZ94Q	57041-67-5			Not metabolized	Desflurane (1,2,2,2-tetrafluoroethyl difluoromethyl ether) is a highly fluorinated methyl ethyl ether used for maintenance of general anesthesia. Like halothane, enflurane and isoflurane, it is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) optical isomers (enantiomers). Together with sevoflurane, it is gradually replacing isoflurane for human use, except in the third world, where its high cost precludes its use. It has the most rapid onset and offset of the volatile anesthetic drugs used for general anesthesia due to its low solubility in blood. Some drawbacks of desflurane are its low potency, its pungency and its high cost. It may cause tachycardia and airway irritability when administered at concentrations greater than 10 vol%. Due to this airway irritability, desflurane is infrequently used to induce anesthesia via inhalation techniques. Though it vaporises very readily, it is a liquid at room temperature. Anaesthetic machines are fitted with a specialized anaesthetic vaporiser unit that heats liquid desflurane to a constant temperature. This enables the agent to be available at a constant vapor pressure, negating the effects fluctuating ambient temperatures would otherwise have on its concentration imparted into the fresh gas flow of the anesthesia machine. Desflurane, along with enflurane and to a lesser extent isoflurane, has been shown to react with the carbon dioxide absorbent in anesthesia circuits to produce detectable levels of carbon monoxide through degradation of the anesthetic agent. The CO2 absorbent, Baralyme, when dried, is most culpable for the production of carbon monoxide from desflurane degradation, although it is also seen with soda lime absorbent as well. Dry conditions in the carbon dioxide absorbent are conducive to this phenomenon, such as those resulting from high fresh gas flows.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dimethyltryptamine	Dimethyltryptamine	6089	DB01488	WUB601BHAA	61-50-7		Oral , Insufflated, Rectal, Smoked , IM, IV		N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT or N,N-DMT) is a psychedelic compound of the tryptamine family. Its presence is widespread throughout the plant kingdom. DMT occurs in trace amounts in mammals, including humans, where it putatively functions as a trace amine neurotransmitter/neuromodulator. It is originally derived from the essential amino acid tryptophan and ultimately produced by the enzyme INMT during normal metabolism. The significance of its widespread natural presence remains undetermined. Structurally, DMT is analogous to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT), the hormone melatonin, and other psychedelic tryptamines, such as 5-MeO-DMT, bufotenin, psilocin and psilocybin. When ingested, DMT acts as a psychedelic drug. Depending on the dose and method of administration, its subjective effects can range from short-lived milder psychedelic states to powerful immersive experiences; these are often described as a total loss of connection to conventional reality with the encounter of ineffable spiritual/alien realms. Indigenous Amazonian Amerindian cultures consume DMT as the primary psychoactive in ayahuasca, a shamanistic brew used for divinatory and healing purposes. Pharmacologically, ayahuasca combines DMT with an MAOI, an enzyme inhibitor that allows DMT to be orally active.

Cathinone induces the release of dopamine from striatal preparations that are prelabelled either with dopamine or its precursors. It is probably the main contributor to the stimulant effect of Catha edulis. Cathinone differs from many other amphetamines in that it has a ketone functional group. Other amphetamines that share this structure include the antidepressant bupropion and the stimulant methcathinone, among others. Internationally, cathinone is a Schedule I drug under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances. Circa 1993, the DEA added cathinone to the Controlled Substances Act's Schedule I. The sale of khat is legal in some jurisdictions, but illegal in others â€” see Khat (Regulation).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etorphine	Etorphine	644209	DB01497	42M2Y6NU9O	14521-96-1				"Etorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid possessing an analgesic potency approximately 1,000-3,000 times that of morphine. It was first prepared in 1960 from oripavine, which does not generally occur in opium poppy extract but rather in ""poppy straw"" and in the related plants Papaver orientale and Papaver bracteatum. It was later reproduced in 1963 by a research group at MacFarlan Smith in Gorgie, Edinburgh, led by Professor Kenneth Bentley. It can also be produced from thebaine. Etorphine is often used to immobilize elephants and other large mammals. Etorphine is available legally only for veterinary use and is strictly governed by law. Diprenorphine (M5050), also known as Revivon, is an opioid receptor antagonist that can be administered in proportion to the amount of etorphine used (1.3 times) to reverse its effects. Veterinary-strength etorphine is fatal to humans. For this reason the package as supplied to vets always includes the human antidote as well as Etorphine. One of its main advantages in general veterinary work is its speed of operation and, more importantly, the speed with which diprenorphine reverses the effects. For example, operations on valuable animals such as racehorses, using alternative anaesthetics risks the animal injuring itself as the anesthetic wears off. The rapid action of etorphine and diprenorphine means the animal can be back on its feet within a relatively short time and aware of its surroundings more quickly, thus reducing any tendency to panic and move around rapidly while still partially under the influence of the anesthetic. For this reason, its use is popular with many vets. Large Animal Immobilon is a combination of etorphine plus acepromazine maleate. An etorphine antidote Large Animal Revivon contains mainly diprenorphine for animals and a human-specific naloxone-based antidote, which should be prepared prior to the etorphine. A close relative, dihydroetorphine, has been used as an opioid painkiller for human usage in China. It is claimed to be less addictive than traditional opioids but this has yet to be confirmed."

It has U.S. F.D.A. approval to treat rheumatoid, juvenile rheumatoid and psoriatic arthritis, plaque psoriasis and ankylosing spondylitis. TNF-alpha is the ""master regulator"" of the inflammatory (immune) response in many organ systems. Autoimmune diseases are caused by an overactive immune response. Etanercept has the potential to treat these diseases by inhibiting TNF-alpha. Etanercept is a fusion protein produced by recombinant DNA. It fuses the TNF receptor to the constant end of the IgG1 antibody. First, the developers isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for soluble TNF receptor 2, which is a receptor that binds to tumor necrosis factor-alpha. Second, they isolated the DNA sequence that codes the human gene for the Fc end of immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1). Third, they linked the DNA for TNF receptor 2 to the DNA for IgG1 Fc. Finally, they expressed the linked DNA to produce a protein that links the protein for TNF receptor 2 to the protein for IgG1 Fc. The prototypic fusion protein was first synthesized and shown to be highly active and unusually stable as a modality for blockade of TNF in vivo in the early 1990s by Bruce A. Beutler, an academic researcher then at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, and his colleagues. These investigators also patented the protein, selling all rights to its use to Immunex, a biotechnology company that was acquired by Amgen in 2002. It is a large molecule, with a molecular weight of 150 kDa. , that binds to TNFÎ± and decreases its role in disorders involving excess inflammation in humans and other animals, including autoimmune diseases such as ankylosing spondylitis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and, potentially, in a variety of other disorders mediated by excess TNFÎ±. In North America, etanercept is co-marketed by Amgen and Pfizer under the trade name Enbrel in two separate formulations, one in powder form, the other as a pre-mixed liquid.

It is used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation, especially in kidney transplants. Daclizumab is currently in phase II clinical trials in the U.S. In April 2008, Hoffmann-La Roche, the pharmaceutical company that markets Daclizumab (under the name ""Zenapax"") in Europe, submitted an application to have its marketing authorisation withdrawn in the EU for commercial reasons. The drug faced diminishing market demand, according to the company. There were no safety concerns with its use. As of January 2009, its marketing authorisation has been withdrawn and the product discontinued completely. It is given in multiple doses, the first 1 hour before the transplant operation and 5 further doses given at two week intervals after the transplant. These saturate the receptors and prevent T cell activation and thus prevent formation of antibodies against the transplant. Like the similar drug basiliximab, daclizumab reduces the incidence and severity of acute rejection in kidney transplantation without increasing the incidence of opportunistic infections. Daclizumab usage may also be indicated in place of a calcineurin-inhibitor during the early phase after kidney transplantation, when the kidney is recovering and vulnerable to calcineurin-inhibitor toxicity. This has been shown to be beneficial in non-heart beating donor kidney transplantation. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended its use be considered for all kidney transplant recipients. In 2006 it began a Phase II clinical trial that finished in 2007 as a possible Multiple Sclerosis treatment. Participants were nine patients with multiple sclerosis not controlled with interferon. Daclizumab was effective in reducing lesions and improving clinical scores. Daclizumab has also been used to slow the progression of autoimmune diseases, particularly that of birdshot chorioretinopathy."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Darbepoetin_alfa	Darbepoetin alfa		DB00012	15UQ94PT4P	11096-26-7				Darbepoetin alfa is a synthetic form of erythropoietin. It stimulates erythropoiesis and is used to treat anemia, commonly associated with chronic renal failure and cancer chemotherapy. Darbepoetin is marketed by Amgen under the trade name Aranesp. The drug was approved in September 2001 by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment of anemia in patients with chronic renal failure by intravenous or subcutaneous injection. In June 2001, it had been approved by the European Medicines Agency for this indication as well as the treatment of anemia in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. Dr. Reddy's Laboratories launched darbepoetin alfa in India under the brand name â€˜Crespâ€™ in August 2010. This is the worldâ€™s first generic darbepoetin alfa. Cresp has been approved in India. Darbepoetin is produced by recombinant DNA technology in modified Chinese hamster ovary cells. It differs from endogenous erythropoietin (EPO) by containing two more N-linked oligosaccharide chains. It is an erythropoiesis-stimulating 165-amino acid protein. Like EPO, its use increases the risk of cardiovascular problems, including cardiac arrest, arrhythmia, hypertension and hypertensive encephalopathy, congestive heart failure, vascular thrombosis or ischemia, myocardial infarction, edema, and stroke. It can also increase risk of seizures. A recent study has extended these findings to treatment of patients exhibiting cancer-related anemia (distinct from anemia resulting from chemotherapy). Pre-existing untreated hypertension is a contra-indication for darbepoetin, as well as some hematologic diseases. Other reported adverse reactions include hypotension, fever, chest pains, nausea and myalgia. Like EPO, it has the potential to be abused by athletes seeking a competitive advantage. Its use during the 2002 Winter Olympic Games to improve performance led to the disqualification of cross-country skiers Larisa Lazutina and Olga Danilova of Russia and Johann MÃ¼hlegg of Spain from their final races. Nevertheless, recent publication in professional literature indicate that the detection of prohibited substances at the 2002 Olympics may have been false as a result of less-than-perfect detection methodology, and the Olympic champions could therefore wrongly suffer IOC sanctions.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dichlorvos	Dichlorvos	3039		7U370BPS14	62-73-7				"Dichlorvos or 2,2-dichlorovinyl dimethyl phosphate is a highly volatile organophosphate, widely used as an organophosphorus insecticide to control household pests, in public health, and protecting stored product from insects. It is effective against mushroom flies, aphids, spider mites, caterpillars, thrips, and whiteflies in greenhouse, outdoor fruit, and vegetable crops. It is also used in the milling and grain handling industries and to treat a variety of parasitic worm infections in dogs, livestock, and humans. It is fed to livestock to control bot fly larvae in the manure. It acts against insects as both a contact and a stomach poison. It is available as an aerosol and soluble concentrate. It is also used in pet collars and ""no-pest strips"" as pesticide-impregnated plastic. In this form it has recently been labeled for use against bed bugs. The United States Environmental Protection Agency first considered a ban on DDVP in 1981. Since then it has been close to being banned on several occasions, but continues to be available. Major concerns are over acute and chronic toxicity. There is no conclusive evidence of carcinogenicity to date, however a 2010 study found that each 10-fold increase in urinary concentration of organophosphate metabolites was associated with a 55% to 72% increase in the odds of ADHD in children. Dichlorvos is absorbed through all routes of exposure. Since it is an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, its overdose symptoms are weakness, headache, tightness in chest, blurred vision, salivation, sweating, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. Dichlorvos damages DNA of insects in museum collections."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etilefrine	Etilefrine	3306		ZB6F8MY53V	709-55-7				Etilefrine is a cardiac stimulant used as an antihypotensive. It is a sympathomimetic amine of the 3-hydroxy-phenylethanolamine series used in treating orthostatic hypotension of neurological, cardiovascular, endocrine or metabolic origin. Intravenous infusion of this compound increases cardiac output, stroke volume, venous return and blood pressure in man and experimental animals, suggesting stimulation of both Î± and Î² adrenergic receptors. However, in vitro studies indicate that etilefrine has a much higher affinity for Î²1 (cardiac) than for Î²2 adrenoreceptors. Intravenous etilefrine increases the pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume, central venous pressure and mean arterial pressure of healthy individuals. Peripheral vascular resistance falls during the infusion of 1â€“8Â mg etilefrine but begins to rise at higher dosage. Marked falls in pulse rate, cardiac output, stroke volume and peripheral bloodflow, accompanied by rises in mean arterial pressure, occur when etilefrine is infused after administration of intravenous propranolol 2,5Â mg. These findings indicate that etilefrine has both Î²1 and Î±1 adrenergic effects in man. In lamens terms, this means any does has lethal potential (see LD50).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bufotenin	Bufotenin	10257	DB01445		487-93-4		Parenteral		Bufotenin (5-OH-DMT), is a tryptamine related to the neurotransmitter serotonin. It is an alkaloid found in the skin of some species of toads; in mushrooms, higher plants, and mammals. The name bufotenin originates from the Bufo genus of toads, which includes several species of psychoactive toads, most notably Bufo alvarius, that secrete bufotoxins from their parotoid glands. Bufotenin is similar in chemical structure to the psychedelics psilocin (4-OH-DMT), 5-MeO-DMT, and DMT, chemicals which also occur in some of the same fungus, plant, and animal species as bufotenin. The psychoactivity of bufotenin has been disputed, though recent studies suggest it is similar in nature to 5-MeO-DMT.

It is not used in clinical practice, but has been illegally manufactured for recreational drug use. It is an analog of Pethidine (Meperidine), but, since it is not used in medicine, the DEA has labeled it a Schedule I drug in the United States. In fact, it is the reversed ester of pethidine and is listed as having 70% of the potency of morphine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/1,3-Benzodioxolylbutanamine	1,3-Benzodioxolylbutanamine	129870			42542-07-4		Oral		"1,3-Benzodioxolylbutanamine is an entactogenic drug of the phenethylamine chemical class. It is the Î±-ethyl analogue of methylenedioxyphenethylamine (MDPEA) and MDA. BDB was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved), the dosage range is listed as 150â€“230Â mg, and the duration is listed as 4â€“8 hours. BDB produces entactogenic, MDMA-like effects. While pleasant and euphoric, BDB is also fairly sedating and some users feel that the lack of stimulant effect makes it less enjoyable than other similar drugs. Additional side effects associated with BDB include nystagmus and dizziness. Very little data exists about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of BDB. Animal studies and anecdotal reports show that BDB is a slightly more potent serotonin releasing agent than its methylated sister compound methylbenzodioxylbutanamine (MBDB; ""Eden"", ""Methyl-J""). However, it is more commonly known as a metabolite of the N-alkylated analogues MBDB and ethylbenzodioxylbutanamine (EBDB; ""Ethyl-J"") which have appeared in so-called methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy"", ""Adam"", ""Empathy"", ""Molly"", ""E"", ""X"", ""XTC"") tablets. While BDB itself has not been reported as being sold as ""Ecstasy"", urine analysis of ""Ecstasy"" users suggest that this drug may have appeared as a street drug, although it is unclear whether the positive urine test for BDB resulted from consumption of BDB itself or merely as a metabolite of MBDB."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/1,3-Benzodioxolyl-N-methylbutanamine	1,3-Benzodioxolyl-N-methylbutanamine	124844			103818-46-8				"MBDB (N-methyl-1,3-benzodioxolylbutanamine) is an entactogen of the phenethylamine chemical class. MBDB is a closely related chemical analogue of MDMA, with the only difference between the two molecules being an ethyl group instead of a methyl group attached to the alpha carbon. It has IC50 values of 5-HT 784 nM dopamine 7825 nM norepinephrine 1233 nM. MBDB was first synthesized by David E. Nichols, a leading pharmacologist and medicinal chemist, and later tested by Alexander Shulgin and described in his book, PiHKAL: A Chemical Love Story. MBDB's dosage, according to PiHKAL, is 180â€“210Â mg; the proper dosage relative to body mass seems unknown. Its duration is 4â€“6 hours, with noticeable after-effects lasting for 1â€“3 hours. MBDB was initially developed as a non-psychedelic entactogen. It has lower effects on the dopamine system in comparison to other entactogens such as MDMA. MBDB causes many mild, MDMA-like effects, such as lowering of social barriers and inhibitions, pronounced sense of empathy and compassion, mood lift, and mild euphoria are all present. MBDB tends to produce less euphoria, psychedelia, and stimulation in comparison. Many users declare that MBDB is a ""watered-down"" version of MDMA. Despite these features which make MBDB less desirable as a recreational drug, it has been suggested that the drug may have greater therapeutic potential than MDMA. Unlike MDMA, MBDB is not internationally scheduled under the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances. The thirty-second meeting of the WHO Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (September 2000) evaluated MBDB and recommended against scheduling. From the WHO Expert Committee assessment of MBDB: Although MBDB is both structurally and pharmacologically similar to MDMA, the limited available data indicate that its stimulant and euphoriant effects are less pronounced than those of MDMA. There have been no reports of adverse or toxic effects of MBDB in humans. Law enforcement data on illicit trafficking of MBDB in Europe suggest that its availability and abuse may now be declining after reaching a peak during the latter half of the 1990s. For these reasons, the Committee did not consider the abuse liability of MBDB would constitute a significant risk to public health, thereby warranting its placement under international control. Scheduling of MBDB was therefore not recommended."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alpha-GPC	Alpha-GPC	71920			28319-77-9				L-Alpha Glycerylphosphorylcholine (Alpha GPC, choline alfoscerate) is a natural choline compound found in the brain and in milk. It is also a parasympathomimetic acetylcholine precursor which may have potential for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and is used as a nootropic dietary supplement to enhance memory and cognition. Alpha GPC rapidly delivers choline to the brain across the bloodâ€“brain barrier and is a biosynthetic precursor of the acetylcholine neurotransmitter. Alpha GPC is derived from highly purified soy lecithin by companies like Lipoid, VAV Life Sciences, Chemi SPA etc. Studies have investigated its efficacy for cognitive disorders including stroke and Alzheimerâ€™s Disease. An Italian multicentre clinical trial on 2,044 patients suffering from recent stroke were supplied alpha-GPC in doses of 1,000Â mg/day for 28Â days and 400Â mg three times per day for the five ensuing months. The trial confirmed the therapeutic role of alpha-GPC on the cognitive recovery of patients based on four measurement scales, three of which reached statistical significance.

It was used as a doping agent to enhance athletic performance, and several athletes tested positive for the drug at the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games, following which it was added to the banned list as a stimulant and masking agent. Research on this class of drugs has been fairly extensive and a large family of derivatives are known, although bromantane remains the best studied, and human trials continue for applications such as increasing endurance under extreme conditions. Study results suggest that the combination of psychostimulant and anxiolytic actions in the spectrum of psychotropic activity of bromantane is effective in treating asthenic disorders compared to placebo. The absence of ""withdrawal syndrome"" demonstrated a lack of addictive potential in this drug. It is considered novel having both stimulant and anti-anxiety properties."

It is a derivative of morphine, to be specific, a hydrogenated ketone thereof, and it can be said that hydromorphone is to morphine as hydrocodone is to codeine and, therefore, a semi-synthetic drug. It is, in medical terms, an opioid analgesic and, in legal terms, a narcotic. Hydromorphone is commonly used in the hospital setting, mostly intravenously (IV) because its bioavailability orally, rectally, and intranasally is very low. Sublingual administration is usually superior to swallowing for bioavailabilty and effects. Hydromorphone is much more soluble in water than morphine and therefore hydromorphone solutions can be produced to deliver the drug in a smaller volume of water. Very small quantities of hydromorphone are detected in assays of opium on rare occasions; it appears to be produced by the plant under circumstances and by processes which are not understood at this time and may include the action of bacteria. A similar process and/or other metabolic processes in the plant may very well be responsible for the very low quantities of hydrocodone also found on rare occasions in opium and alkaloid mixtures derived therefrom; dihydrocodeine, oxymorphol, oxycodone, oxymorphone, metopon and possibly other derivatives of morphine and/or hydromorphone also are found in trace amounts in opium.

It is a low-potency antipsychotic (approximately half as potent as chlorpromazine) with strong analgesic and antiemetic properties. Serious side effects include tardive dyskinesia, akathisia, and the potentially fatal neuroleptic malignant syndrome. As is typical of phenothiazine antipsychotics, levomepromazine is a ""dirty drug"": it exerts its effects by blocking a variety of receptors, including adrenergic receptors, dopamine receptors, histamine receptors, muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, and serotonin receptors. Currently, levomepromazine is not registered in the USA, although some American physicians are conducting studies regarding the strong analgesic effect of levomepromazine. In Europe it has been marketed for decades as Neurocil and Nozinan (manufactured by Sanofi-Avensis). Nozinan is also available in Canada. Nozinan is available in round tablets of 5, 25 or 100Â mg."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linezolid	Linezolid	441401	DB00601	ISQ9I6J12J	165800-03-3		Intravenous infusion, oral	Hepatic	Linezolid is a synthetic antibiotic developed by a team at Pharmacia and Upjohn Company. It is used for the treatment of serious infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria that are resistant to several other antibiotics. A member of the oxazolidinone class of drugs, linezolid is active against most Gram-positive bacteria that cause disease, including streptococci, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). The main indications of linezolid are infections of the skin and soft tissues and pneumonia, although off-label use for a variety of other infections is becoming popular. Linezolid is marketed by Pfizer under the trade names Zyvox (in the United States, United Kingdom, Australia, and several other countries), Zyvoxid (in Europe), and Zyvoxam (in Canada and Mexico). Generics are also available, such as Linospan (in India, by Cipla) and Arlin (in Bangladesh, by Beximco). Discovered in the 1990s and first approved for use in 2000, linezolid was the first commercially available 1,3-oxazolidinone antibiotic. As of 2009, it is the only marketed oxazolidinone, although others are in development. As a protein synthesis inhibitor, it stops the growth of bacteria by disrupting their production of proteins. Although many antibiotics work this way, the exact mechanism of action of linezolid appears to be unique in that it blocks the initiation of protein production, and not one of the later steps. Bacterial resistance to linezolid has remained very low since it was first detected in 1999, although it may be increasing. When administered for short periods, linezolid is a relatively safe drug; it can be used in patients of all ages and in people with liver disease or poor kidney function. Common adverse effects of short-term use include headache, diarrhea, and nausea. Long-term use, however, has been associated with serious adverse effects; linezolid can cause bone marrow suppression and low platelet counts, particularly when used for more than two weeks. If used for longer periods still, it may cause peripheral neuropathy (which can be irreversible), optic nerve damage, and lactic acidosis (a buildup of lactic acid in the body), all most likely due to mitochondrial toxicity. Linezolid is very expensive, costing approximately US$100 per pill in the United States. Nonetheless, it appears to be more cost-effective than comparable antibiotics, such as vancomycin, mostly because of the possibility of switching from intravenous to oral administration as soon as patients are stable enough, without the need for dose adjustments.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midazolam	Midazolam	4192	DB00683	R60L0SM5BC	59467-70-8		Oral, I.M., I.V., parenteral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Midazolam is a short-acting drug in the benzodiazepine class developed by Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1970s. The drug is used for treatment of acute seizures, moderate to severe insomnia, and for inducing sedation and amnesia before medical procedures. It possesses profoundly potent anxiolytic, amnestic, hypnotic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant, and sedative properties. Midazolam has a fast recovery time and is the most commonly used benzodiazepine as a premedication for sedation; less commonly it is used for induction and maintenance of anesthesia. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine antagonist drug, can be used to treat an overdose of midazolam, as well as to reverse sedation. However, flumazenil can trigger seizures in mixed overdoses and in benzodiazepine-dependent individuals, so is not used in most cases. Administration of midazolam by the intranasal or the buccal route (absorption via the gums and cheek) as an alternative to rectally administered diazepam is becoming increasingly popular for the emergency treatment of seizures in children. Midazolam is also used for endoscopy procedural sedation and sedation in intensive care. The anterograde amnesia property of midazolam is useful for premedication before surgery to inhibit unpleasant memories. Midazolam, like many other benzodiazepines, has a rapid onset of action, high effectiveness and low toxicity level. Drawbacks of midazolam include drug interactions, tolerance, and withdrawal syndrome, as well as adverse events including cognitive impairment and sedation. Paradoxical effects occasionally occur, most commonly in children and the elderly, particularly after intravenous administration.

In the technical sense, it is a naphthyridone, not a quinolone: its ring structure is a 1,8-naphthyridine nucleus that contains two nitrogen atoms, unlike quinoline, which has a single nitrogen atom. Synthetic quinolone antibiotics were discovered by George Lesher and coworkers as a byproduct of chloroquine manufacture in the 1960s. Used clinically from 1967. Nalidixic acid is effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. In lower concentrations, it acts in a bacteriostatic manner; that is, it inhibits growth and reproduction. In higher concentrations, it is bactericidal, meaning that it kills bacteria instead of merely inhibiting their growth. It has historically been used for treating urinary tract infections, caused, for example, by Escherichia coli, Proteus, Shigella, Enterobacter, and Klebsiella. It is no longer clinically used for this indication in the USA as less toxic and more effective agents are available. It is also a tool in studies as a regulation of bacterial division. It selectively and reversibly blocks DNA replication in susceptible bacteria. Nalidixic acid and related antibiotics inhibit a subunit of DNA gyrase and induce formation of relaxation complex analogue. It also inhibits the nicking dosing activity on the subunit of DNA gyrase that releases the positive binding stress on the supercoiled DNA.

It was discovered in a US National Cancer Institute program at the Research Triangle Institute in 1967 when Monroe E. Wall and Mansukh C. Wani isolated it from the bark of the Pacific yew tree, Taxus brevifolia and named it taxol. Later it was discovered that endophytic fungi in the bark synthesize paclitaxel. When it was developed commercially by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS), the generic name was changed to paclitaxel and the BMS compound is sold under the trademark Taxol. In this formulation, paclitaxel is dissolved in Cremophor EL and ethanol, as a delivery agent. A newer formulation, in which paclitaxel is bound to albumin, is sold under the trademark Abraxane. Paclitaxel is used to treat patients with lung, ovarian, breast, head and neck cancer, and advanced forms of Kaposi's sarcoma. Paclitaxel is also used for the prevention of restenosis. Paclitaxel stabilizes microtubules and as a result, interferes with the normal breakdown of microtubules during cell division. Together with docetaxel, it forms the drug category of the taxanes. It was the subject of a notable total synthesis by Robert A. Holton. While offering substantial improvement in patient care, paclitaxel has been a relatively controversial drug. There was originally concern because of the environmental impact of its original sourcing (no longer used) from the Pacific yew. In addition, the assignment of rights to Bristol-Myers Squibb, and even the name itself, were the subject of public debate and Congressional hearings.

Phenytoin acts to suppress the abnormal brain activity seen in seizure by reducing electrical conductance among brain cells by stabilizing the inactive state of voltage-gated sodium channels. Aside from seizures, it is an option in the treatment of trigeminal neuralgia in the event that carbamazepine or other first-line treatment seems inappropriate. It is sometimes considered a class 1b antiarrhythmic.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Primidone	Primidone	4909	DB00794	13AFD7670Q	125-33-7		oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Primidone is an anticonvulsant of the pyrimidinedione class, the active metabolites of which, phenobarbital (major) and phenylethylmalonamide (PEMA) (minor), are also anticonvulsants. It is used mainly to treat complex partial, simple partial, generalized tonic-clonic seizures, myoclonic, and akinetic seizures and since the 1980s it has been a valuable alternative to propranolol in the treatment of essential tremor. Unlike other anticonvulsants such as carbamazepine and valproic acid, primidone is rarely used in the treatment of bipolar disorder or any other psychiatric problem. It is also not widely used in treatment of neuropathic pain, trigeminal neuralgia, migraine. Primidone has been occasionally used to treat long QT syndrome, cerebral palsy, and athetosis. Primidone was once a mainstay anticonvulsant in the treatment of partial and generalized seizures and was the treatment of choice for secondarily generalized seizures originating in the temporal lobes, especially when combined with phenytoin, but by the early 1980s, carbamazepine had surpassed it in popularity due to the latter's lower incidence of sedation. As time passed and more and more anticonvulsants came on the market, primidone was pushed further and further away from its former place of prominence and major Western pharmaceutical corporations became less and less interested in manufacturing and selling it. It has largely fallen into disuse in the developed world as more and more anticonvulsants entered the market and has been withdrawn from markets all over the world. Unlike many other anticonvulsants, primidone works via interactions with voltage-gated sodium channels which inhibit high-frequency repetitive firing of action potentials. It is much less toxic in overdose than phenobarbital. Along with carbamazepine, phenobarbital, and phenytoin, primidone is an inducer of metabolic enzymes in the liver, which means that it accelerates the metabolism of many other pharmaceuticals. Like other anticonvulsants that entered the market before 1989, primidone has been associated with hyperhomocysteinemia, folate deficiency and its various symptoms, reduced calcium absorption, and various bone diseases. It also shares with most other anticonvulsants the tendency to cause sedation.

The antihypertensive actions of reserpine are a result of its ability to deplete catecholamines from peripheral sympathetic nerve endings. These substances are normally involved in controlling heart rate, force of cardiac contraction and peripheral resistance. Reserpine mediated depletion of monoamine neurotransmitters in the synapses is often cited as evidence to the theory that depletion of the neurotransmitters causes subsequent depression in humans. However, this claim is not without controversy. The reserpine-induced depression is considered by some researchers to be a myth, while others claim that teas made out of the plant roots containing reserpine have a calming, sedative action that can actually be considered antidepressant. Notably, reserpine was the first compound shown to be an effective antidepressant in a randomized placebo-controlled trial. Moreover, reserpine has a peripheral action in many parts of the body, resulting in a preponderance of the effects of the cholinergic part of the autonomous nervous system on the GI tract, smooth muscles, blood vessels, etc.

Ribavirin is a prodrug, which when metabolized resembles purine RNA nucleotides. In this form it interferes with RNA metabolism required for viral replication. How it exactly affects viral replication is unknown; many mechanisms have been proposed for this (see Mechanisms of Action, below) but none of these has been proven to date. Multiple mechanisms may be responsible for its actions. The primary observed serious adverse side effect of ribavirin is hemolytic anemia, which may worsen preexisting cardiac disease. The mechanism for this effect is due to ribavirin's buildup inside erythrocytes. Oxidative damage to erythrocyte cell membrane is usually inhibited by glutathione; however, with reduced ATP levels caused by ribavirin, glutathione levels are impaired, permitting oxidative erythrocyte cell lysis. The gradual loss of erythrocytes leads to anemia. The anemia is dose-dependent and may sometimes be compensated by decreasing dose. Ribavirin is also a teratogen in some animals species and thus poses a theoretical reproductive risk in humans, remaining a hazard as long as the drug is present, which can be as long as 6 months after a course of the drug has ended.

It is a semisynthetic compound derived from Amycolatopsis rifamycinica (formerly known as Amycolatopsis mediterranei and Streptomyces mediterranei). Rifampicin may be abbreviated R, RMP, RA, RF, or RIF (US). In 1957, a soil sample from a pine forest on the French Riviera was brought for analysis to the Lepetit Pharmaceuticals research lab in Milan, Italy. There, a research group headed by Prof. Piero Sensi (1920-) and Dr. Maria Teresa Timbal (1925 - 1969) discovered a new bacterium. This new species appeared immediately of great scientific interest since it was producing a new class of molecules with antibiotic activity. Because Sensi, Timbal and the researchers were particularly fond of the French crime story Rififi (about a jewel heist and rival gangs), they decided to call these compounds ""rifamycins"". After two years of attempts to obtain more stable semisynthetic products, a new molecule with high efficacy and good tolerability was produced in 1959 and was named ""rifampicin"". Rifampicin is also known as rifaldazine, R/AMP, rofact (in Canada), and rifampin in the United States. There are various types of rifamycins from which this is derived, but the rifampicin form, with a 4-methyl-1-piperazinaminyl group, is by far the most clinically effective. Rifampicin is an intensely red solid, and the small fraction which reaches body fluids is known for imparting a harmless red-orange color to the urine (and to a lesser extent, also sweat and tears) of users, for a few hours after a dose. Maximal concentrations in the blood are decreased by about a third when the antibiotic is taken with food."

Rofecoxib was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 20, 1999, and was marketed under the brand names Vioxx, Ceoxx, and Ceeoxx. Rofecoxib gained widespread acceptance among physicians treating patients with arthritis and other conditions causing chronic or acute pain. Worldwide, over 80 million people were prescribed rofecoxib at some time. On September 30, 2004, Merck voluntarily withdrew rofecoxib from the market because of concerns about increased risk of heart attack and stroke associated with long-term, high-dosage use. Merck withdrew the drug after disclosures that it withheld information about rofecoxib's risks from doctors and patients for over five years, resulting in between 88,000 and 140,000 cases of serious heart disease. Rofecoxib was one of the most widely used drugs ever to be withdrawn from the market. In the year before withdrawal, Merck had sales revenue of US$2.5 billion from Vioxx. By the time it was discontinued in 2004, it had already caused an estimated 60,000 deaths worldwide. Rofecoxib was available on prescription as tablets and as an oral suspension.

Knutsen describing the design, selection, pharmacology and synthesis of tiagabine was published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry in 1993, pulling together the work of the team at Novo Nordisk. The drug and was co-developed with Abbott, in a 40/60 cost sharing deal, with Abbott paying a premium for licensing the IP from the Danish company. Abbott did initially embrace the drug enthusiastically after its US launch in 1998, and provided further clinical studies with the goal of gaining FDA approval for monotherapy in epilepsy. However, the senior management at Abbott drew back after realizing that the original deal with Novo would limit the company's financial gain from a monotherapy approval. After a period of co-promotion, Cephalon licensed Tiagabine from Abbott/Novo and now is the exclusive producer.

Like other benzodiazepines, it possesses anxiolytic properties but unlike other benzodiazepines it does not have anticonvulsant, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, motor skill-impairing or amnestic properties. While it may not be an anticonvulsant in and of itself, it has been shown to enhance the anticonvulsant action of classical 1,4-benzodiazepines such as diazepam. Tofisopam is indicated for the treatment of anxiety and alcohol withdrawal, and is prescribed in a dosage of 50 â€“ 300Â mg per day divided into three doses. Peak plasma levels are attained two hours after an oral dose. Tofisopam is not reported as causing dependence to the same extent as other benzodiazepines, but is still recommended to be prescribed for a maximum of 12 weeks. Tofisopam is not approved for sale in the United States or Canada. However, Vela Pharmaceuticals of New Jersey is developing the D-enantiomer (dextofisopam) as a treatment for irritable bowel syndrome, with moderate efficacy demonstrated in clinical trials so far. Tofisopam is also claimed to be a PDE10A inhibitor, which may provide an alternative mechanism of action for its various therapeutic effects, and this action has been proposed to make tofisopam potentially useful as a treatment for schizophrenia. Tofisopam has been shown to act as an inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP3A4, and this could potentially cause dangerous drug interactions with other medications metabolised by this enzyme, although the clinical significance of these findings remains unclear.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vancomycin	Vancomycin	14969	DB00512	6Q205EH1VU	1404-90-6		IV, oral	Excreted unchanged	"Vancomycin INN is a glycopeptide antibiotic used in the prophylaxis and treatment of infections caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Vancomycin was first isolated in 1953 at Eli Lilly, from a soil sample collected from the interior jungles of Borneo by a missionary. It is a naturally occurring antibiotic made by the soil bacterium Actinobacteria species Amycolatopsis orientalis (formerly designated Nocardia orientalis). It is a complex chemical compound and an example of a comparatively rare haloorganic natural compound, containing two covalently bonded chlorine atoms. The compound was industrially produced by fermentation and given the generic name vancomycin, derived from the term ""vanquish. "" The original indication for vancomycin was for the treatment of penicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, a use kept alive for many years by the fact that compound had to be given intravenously and was thus not abused outside hospitals, and the fact that organisms were relatively slow to evolve to adapt to it, even in experiments. For many years since its initial use, vancomycin has traditionally been reserved as a drug of ""last resort"", used only after treatment with other antibiotics had failed,. Recently, however, vancomycin resistant organisms are becoming common. Thus, vancomycin is increasingly being displaced from this role by newer antibiotics such as linezolid (Zyvox), daptomycin (Cubicin), and quinupristin/dalfopristin (Synercid)."

Together with desflurane, it is replacing isoflurane and halothane in modern anesthesiology. It is often administered in a mixture of nitrous oxide and oxygen. After desflurane, it is the volatile anesthetic with the fastest onset and offset. Though desflurane has the lowest blood/gas coefficient of the currently used volatile anesthetics, sevoflurane is the preferred agent for mask induction due to its lesser irritation to mucous membranes. First reports of sevoflurane appeared in the literature in 1971. The agent was developed by Ross Terrell, PhD. It was introduced into clinical practice initially in Japan in 1990. Its name comes from having seven fluorine atoms. The rights for sevoflurane in the US and other countries were held by Abbott Laboratories. It is now available as a generic drug.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isoflurane	Isoflurane	3763	DB00753	CYS9AKD70P	26675-46-7				Isoflurane (2-chloro-2--1,1,1-trifluoro-ethane) is a halogenated ether used for inhalational anesthesia. Together with enflurane and halothane, it replaced the flammable ethers used in the pioneer days of surgery. Its name comes from being a structural isomer of enflurane, hence they have the same empirical formula. It is a racemic mixture of (R) and (S) optical isomers. Its use in human medicine is now starting to decline, being replaced with sevoflurane, desflurane and the intravenous anaesthetic propofol. Isoflurane is still frequently used for veterinary anaesthesia. Isoflurane is always administered in conjunction with air and/or pure oxygen. Often nitrous oxide is also used. Although its physical properties imply that anaesthesia can be induced more rapidly than with halothane, its pungency can irritate the respiratory system, negating this theoretical advantage conferred by its physical properties. It is usually used to maintain a state of general anesthesia that has been induced with another drug, such as thiopentone or propofol. It vaporizes readily, but is a liquid at room temperature. It is completely nonflammable.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Infliximab	Infliximab		DB00065	B72HH48FLU	170277-31-3		IV	reticuloendothelial system	Infliximab (INN; trade name Remicade) is a monoclonal antibody against tumour necrosis factor alpha used to treat autoimmune diseases. Remicade is marketed by Janssen Biotech, Inc. (formerly Centocor Biotech, Inc. ) in the USA, Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma in Japan, Xian Janssen in China, and Schering-Plough (now part of Merck & Co) elsewhere. Infliximab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of psoriasis, Crohn's disease, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and ulcerative colitis. Infliximab won its initial approval by the FDA for the treatment of Crohn's disease in August 1998. Infliximab works by binding to tumour necrosis factor alpha. TNF-Î± is a chemical messenger and a key part of the autoimmune reaction. Originally, the action of infliximab (in rheumatoid arthritis) was assumed to work by blocking the action of TNF-Î± by preventing it from binding to its receptor in the cell. This still seems to be true. However, another TNF-Î±-neutralizing medication, etanercept (Enbrel), is worse than a placebo in Crohn's disease, so TNF-Î±-neutralisation is not responsible for its powerful action in the latter disease. Infliximab causes programmed cell death of TNF-Î±-expressing activated T lymphocytes, an important cell type mediating inflammation, but etanercept does not have this activity; now, resolution of activated T cells by infliximab is generally assumed to explain its efficacy in Crohn's disease. Infliximab is an artificial antibody. It was originally developed in mice as a mouse antibody. Because humans have immune reactions to mouse proteins, the mouse common domains were replaced with similar human antibody domains. Because the antibodies were produced from one cell grown into a clone of identical cells, it is called a monoclonal antibody. Furthermore, as a combination of mouse and human antibody amino acid sequences, it is called a chimeric monoclonal antibody. Infliximab was developed by Junming Le and Jan Vilcek at New York University School of Medicine and developed by Centocor, (now Janssen Biotech, Inc. ) Infliximab can cost $19,000 to $22,000 a year per patient wholesale, according to Centocor. It is typically covered under major medical insurance (rather than prescription drug insurance). Other monoclonal antibodies targeting TNF-Î± are golimumab (Simponi), adalimumab (Humira), and certolizumab pegol (Cimzia). Etanercept also binds and inhibits the action of TNF-Î±, but is not a monoclonal antibody (it is instead a fusion of TNF-receptor and an antibody constant region). Infliximab is administered by intravenous infusion, typically at six- to eight-week intervals, at a clinic or hospital. It cannot be administered orally because the digestive system would destroy the drug.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omalizumab	Omalizumab		DB00043	2P471X1Z11	242138-07-4		subcutaneous injection		Omalizumab is a humanized antibody approved for patients 12 years and older with moderate to severe allergic asthma in the United States and with severe, persistent allergic asthma in many other countries. It has also been approved for pediatric patients 6 to 11 years old with severe, persistent allergic asthma in the European Union. Omalizumab's cost is high, ranging from $6,000 to $24,000 a year and hence omalizumab is mainly prescribed for patients with severe, persistent asthma, which cannot be controlled even with high doses of corticosteroids. Omalizumab is a recombinant DNA-derived humanized IgG1k monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to free human immunoglobulin E (IgE) in the blood and interstitial fluid and to membrane-bound form of IgE (mIgE) on the surface of mIgE-expressing B lymphocytes. Unlike an ordinary anti-IgE antibody, omalizumab does not bind to IgE that is already bound by the high affinity IgE receptor (FcÎµRI) on the surface of mast cells, basophils, and antigen-presenting dendritic cells. IgE is commonly involved in type I hypersensitivity, which manifests the most prevalent allergic diseases. It has been estimated that as high as 20 to 40% of the populations who live a western lifestyle in economically advanced countries are affected by allergy and seek medical help. While allergy occurs more frequently in individuals with higher serum IgE levels, such a correlation is only statistical and not absolute. Some allergic individuals have very low serum IgE, and some people with very high IgE have no allergic problems.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urokinase	Urokinase		DB00013	83G67E21XI	9039-53-6				Urokinase (trade name Abbokinase), also called urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA), is a serine protease. It was ï¬ﾁrst discovered in 1947 by McFarlane. (Nursing grand rounds pdfs. journals. lww. com/... /Nursing_grand_rounds.8. pdf J Vitello-Cicciu - 1987). Urokinase was originally isolated from human urine, but is present in several physiological locations, such as blood stream and the extracellular matrix. The primary physiological substrate is plasminogen, which is an inactive zymogen form of the serine protease plasmin. Activation of plasmin triggers a proteolysis cascade that, depending on the physiological environment, participates in thrombolysis or extracellular matrix degradation. This links urokinase to vascular diseases and cancer.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Obidoxime	Obidoxime	5485192		N6KNE1QA9O	114-90-9				Obidoxime is a member of the oxime family used to treat nerve gas poisoning. Oximes are drugs known for their ability to reverse the binding of organophosphorus compounds to the enzyme acetylcholinesterase (AChE). AChE is an enzyme that removes acetylcholine from the synapse after it creates the required stimulation on the next nerve cell. If it gets inhibited, acetylcholine is not removed after the stimulation and multiple stimulations are made, resulting in muscle contractions and paralysis. Organophosphates (such as nerve gases) are well known inhibitors of AChE. They bind to a specific place on the enzyme and prevent it from functioning normally by changing the OH group on the serine residue and by protonating the nearby nitrogen atom located in the histidine residue.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Moxidectin	Moxidectin			NGU5H31YO9	113507-06-5		oral, subcutaneous, topical		Moxidectin kills parasites, so is used for the prevention and control of heartworm and intestinal worms, and can be found in treatments prescribed for animals such as dogs, cats, horses, cattle and sheep. Application methods for moxidectin vary by treatment, and include oral, topical, and injectable solutions. Cydectin Pour On is a trade name for a formulation for use on cattle and red deer. Moxidectin is a semisynthetic derivative of nemadectin which is produced by fermentation by Streptomyces cyano-griseus. This Streptomyces species was discovered in a soil sample from Australia in the late 1980s collected by an agronomist working for the American Cyanamid company. Moxidectin treats and controls some of the most common internal and external parasites by selectively binding to parasitesâ€™ glutamate-gated chloride ion channels. These channels are vital to the function of invertebrate nerve and muscle cells; when moxidectin binds to the channels, it disrupts neurotransmission, resulting in paralysis and death of the parasite. Studies of moxidectin show the side effects vary by animal and may be affected by the productâ€™s formulation, application method and dosage. The products are usually recommended by a veterinarian to ensure correct use and application. Herding dogs may be avermectin-sensitive, but avermectin-sensitive dogs can tolerate standard doses for heartworm prevention. Moxidectin is apparently safe for collie breeds. As a heartworm preventative, moxidectin can be injected once every six months under the brand name Proheart6, or every 12 months under the brand name Proheart SR 12. Moxidectin is the subject of a trial to assess its suitability, as an alternative to ivermectin, to treat onchocerciasis in humans.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menotropin	Menotropin			5Y9QQM372Q	61489-71-2				Menotropin (also called human menopausal gonadotropin or HMG) is an active substance for the treatment of fertility disturbances. It consists of gonadotropins that are extracted from the urine of postmenopausal women, usually luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Often, it contains human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) as well. Menotropin preparations (Ferring's Menopur and Repronex) are used for stimulating hormones by triggering FSH and LH production in the body. This drug was originally designed for use in women where it stimulates the ovaries to produce multiple follicles, thus making them more fertile. Human urinary-derived menotropin preparations are exposed to the theoretical risk of infection from menopausal donors of urine. Nevertheless, the failure to demonstrate irrefutably infectivity following intracerebral inoculation with urine from TSE-infected hosts suggests that the risk associated with products derived from urine is merely theoretical. The Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine reported: â€œCompared with earlier crude animal extracts, modern highly purified urinary and recombinant gonadotropin products have clearly superior quality, specific activity, and performance. There are no confirmed differences in safety, purity, or clinical efficacy among the various available urinary or recombinant gonadotropin products. â€ﾝ

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitamin_A	Vitamin A	445354	DB00162		68-26-8				Vitamin A is a group of nutritionally unsaturated hydrocarbons, which include retinol, retinal, retinoic acid and several provitamin A carotenoids among which beta-carotene is the most important. Vitamin A has multiple functions, it is important for growth and development, for the maintenance of the immune system and good vision. Vitamin A is needed by the retina of the eye in the form of retinal, which combines with protein opsin to form rhodopsin the light-absorbing molecule, that is necessary for both low-light and color vision. Vitamin A also functions in a very different role as an irreversibly oxidized form of retinol known as retinoic acid, which is an important hormone-like growth factor for epithelial and other cells. In foods of animal origin, the major form of vitamin A is an ester, primarily retinyl palmitate, which is converted to retinol in the small intestine. The retinol form functions as a storage form of the vitamin, and can be converted to and from its visually active aldehyde form, retinal. The associated acid (retinoic acid), a metabolite that can be irreversibly synthesized from vitamin A, has only partial vitamin A activity, and does not function in the retina for the visual cycle. Retinoic acid is used for growth and cellular differentiation. All forms of vitamin A have a beta-ionone ring to which an isoprenoid chain is attached, called a retinyl group. Both structural features are essential for vitamin activity. The orange pigment of carrots â€“ beta-carotene â€“ can be represented as two connected retinyl groups, which are used in the body to contribute to vitamin A levels. Alpha-carotene and gamma-carotene also have a single retinyl group, which give them some vitamin activity. None of the other carotenes have vitamin activity. The carotenoid beta-cryptoxanthin possesses an ionone group and has vitamin activity in humans. Vitamin A can be found in two principal forms in foods: Retinol, the form of vitamin A absorbed when eating animal food sources, is a yellow, fat-soluble substance. Since the pure alcohol form is unstable, the vitamin is found in tissues in a form of retinyl ester. It is also commercially produced and administered as esters such as retinyl acetate or palmitate. The carotenes alpha-carotene, beta-carotene, gamma-carotene; and the xanthophyll beta-cryptoxanthin (all of which contain beta-ionone rings), but no other carotenoids, function as provitamin A in herbivores and omnivore animals, which possess the enzyme (15-15'-dioxygenase) which cleaves beta-carotene in the intestinal mucosa and converts it retinol. In general, carnivores are poor converters of ionine-containing carotenoids, and pure carnivores such as cats and ferrets lack 15-15'-dioxygenase and cannot convert any carotenoids to retinal (resulting in none of the carotenoids being forms of vitamin A for these species).

It is a cyclopyrrolone, which increases the normal transmission of the signal substance GABA in the central nervous system, as benzodiazepines do, but in a different way. As zopiclone is sedating it is marketed as a sleeping pill. It works by causing a depression or tranquilization of the central nervous system. After prolonged use the body can become accustomed to the effects of zopiclone. When the dose is then reduced or the drug is stopped, withdrawal symptoms may result. These can include a range of symptoms similar to those of benzodiazepine withdrawal. In the United States, zopiclone is not commercially available, although its active stereoisomer, eszopiclone, is sold under the name Lunesta (see History). Zopiclone is a controlled substance in the United States, Japan, Brazil, and some European countries, and may be illegal to possess without a prescription. Zopiclone is known colloquially as a ""Z-drug. "" Other Z-drugs include zaleplon (Sonata) and zolpidem (Ambien and AmbienCR) and were initially thought to be less addictive and/or habit forming than benzodiazepines. However, this appraisal has shifted somewhat in the last few years as cases of addiction and habituation have been presented. It is recommended that zopiclone be taken on a short-term basis, usually a week or less. Daily or continuous use of the drug is not usually advised."

Lorazepam is used for the short-term treatment of anxiety, insomnia, acute seizures including status epilepticus and sedation of hospitalized patients, as well as sedation of aggressive patients. Lorazepam is considered to be a short-acting drug which, similar to other benzodiazepines, exerts its therapeutic effects via its interaction at benzodiazepine binding sites, which are located on GABAA receptors in the central nervous system. After its introduction in 1977, lorazepam's principal use was in treating anxiety. Among benzodiazepines, lorazepam has a relatively high addictive potential. Lorazepam also has abuse potential; the main types of misuse are for recreational purposes or continued use against medical advice. Its sedative-hypnotic and anterograde amnesia properties are sometimes used for criminal purposes. Long-term effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, dependence, a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, and cognitive impairments which may not completely reverse after cessation of treatment; however, for most patients, cognitive impairment is not severe. Withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and insomnia to seizures and psychosis. Due to tolerance and dependence, lorazepam is recommended for short-term use, up to two to four weeks only. Adverse effects, including anterograde amnesia, depression and paradoxical effects such as excitement or worsening of seizures, may occur. Children and the elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Lorazepam impairs body balance and standing steadiness and is associated with falls and hip fractures in the elderly.

Long-term effects of benzodiazepines include tolerance, dependence, a benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome, and cognitive impairments which may not completely reverse after cessation of treatment; however, for most patients, cognitive impairment is not severe. Withdrawal symptoms can range from anxiety and insomnia to seizures and psychosis. Due to tolerance and dependence, lorazepam is recommended for short-term use, up to two to four weeks only. Adverse effects, including anterograde amnesia, depression and paradoxical effects such as excitement or worsening of seizures, may occur. Children and the elderly are more sensitive to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines. Lorazepam impairs body balance and standing steadiness and is associated with falls and hip fractures in the elderly.

In lab animals: also injection.	Hepatic via CYP1A2 mediated 6-hydroxylation	Melatonin Listen/ËŒmÉ›lÉ™ËˆtoÊŠnÉªn/, also known chemically as N-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine, is a naturally occurring compound found in animals, plants, and microbes. In animals, circulating levels of the hormone melatonin vary in a daily cycle, thereby allowing the entrainment of the circadian rhythms of several biological functions. Many biological effects of melatonin are produced through activation of melatonin receptors, while others are due to its role as a pervasive and powerful antioxidant, with a particular role in the protection of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Products containing melatonin have been available over-the-counter in the United States since the mid-1990s. In many other countries, the sale of this neurohormone is not permitted or requires a prescription.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methadone	Methadone	4095	DB00333	UC6VBE7V1Z	76-99-3		Oral, intravenous, insufflation, sublingual, rectal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Methadone (also known as Symoron, Dolophine, Amidone, Methadose, Physeptone, Heptadon and many other names) is a synthetic opioid. It is used medically as an analgesic and a maintenance anti-addictive and reductive preparation for use by patients with opioid dependency. It was developed in Germany in 1937, mainly because Germany required a reliable internal source of opiates. Because it is an acyclic analog of morphine, methadone acts on the same opioid receptors and thus has many of the same effects. Methadone is also used in managing severe chronic pain, owing to its long duration of action, extremely powerful effects, and very low cost. Methadone was introduced into the United States in 1947 by Eli Lilly and Company. Methadone is mainly used in the treatment of opioid dependence. It has cross-tolerance with other opioids including heroin and morphine, offering very similar effects and a longer duration of effect. Oral doses of methadone can stabilise patients by mitigating opioid withdrawal syndrome. Higher doses of methadone can block the euphoric effects of heroin, morphine, and similar drugs. As a result, properly dosed methadone patients can reduce or stop altogether their use of these substances. Methadone is approved for different indications in different countries. Common is approval as an analgesic and approval for the treatment of opioid dependence. It is not intended to reduce the use of non-opioid drugs such as methamphetamine, or alcohol. A number of pharmaceutical companies produce and distribute methadone. The racemic hydrochloride is the only form available in most countries, such as the Netherlands, Belgium, France and in the United States, as of March 2008. The dextrorotary enantiomer of methadone, dextromethadone, is an NMDA antagonist rather than an opiate agonist. Therefore, methadone medications used for opiate addiction sometimes only contain levomethadone, the levorotary enantiomer. Levomethadone is available under the trade names Polamidone and Heptadon, among others. Covidien, is the major racemic methadone producer and sells bulk methadone to producers of generic preparations and distributes its own product in the form of tablets, dispersible tablets and oral concentrate under the brand name Methadose in the United States.

Methamphetamine occurs in two enantiomers, dextrorotary and levorotary; dextromethamphetamine possesses the well-known psychostimulant effects of the drug, while levomethamphetamine is CNS-inactive. Although rarely prescribed, methamphetamine hydrochloride is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of ADHD and obesity under the trade name Desoxyn. Illicitly, methamphetamine may be sold either as pure dextromethamphetamine or in a racemic mixture. Both dextromethamphetamine and racemic methamphetamine are Schedule II controlled substances in the United States, and similarly the production, distribution, sale, and possession of methamphetamine is restricted or illegal in many jurisdictions. Internationally, methamphetamine has been placed in Schedule II of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances treaty. In low dosages, methamphetamine can increase alertness, concentration, and energy in fatigued individuals. In higher doses, it can induce mania with accompanying euphoria, feelings of self-esteem and increased libido. Methamphetamine has a high potential for abuse and addiction, activating the psychological reward system by triggering a cascading release of dopamine in the brain characterized as Amphetamine/Stimulant psychosis. Chronic abuse may also lead to post-withdrawal syndrome, a result of methamphetamine-induced neurotoxicity to dopaminergic neurons. Post-withdrawal syndrome can persist beyond the withdrawal period for months, and sometimes up to a year. In addition to psychological harm, physical harmÂ â€“ primarily consisting of cardiovascular damageÂ â€“ may occur with chronic use or acute overdose.

While it is found in the opium poppy, papaverine differs in both structure and pharmacological action from the analgesic (morphine-related) opium alkaloids.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paroxetine	Paroxetine	43815	DB00715	41VRH5220H	61869-08-7		Oral	Extensive, hepatic	Paroxetine (also known by the trade names Aropax, Paxil, Pexeva, Seroxat, Sereupin) is an antidepressant drug of the SSRI type. Paroxetine is used to treat major depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, panic disorder, social anxiety, posttraumatic stress disorder and generalized anxiety disorder in adult outpatients. Marketing of the drug began in 1992 by the pharmaceutical company SmithKline Beecham, now GlaxoSmithKline. Generic formulations have been available since 2003 when the patent expired. In adults, the efficacy of paroxetine for depression is comparable to that of older tricyclic antidepressants, with fewer side effects and lower toxicity. Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and mostly confined to side effects. It shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, somnolence, and sexual side effects. Paroxetine is associated with clinically significant weight gain. Pediatric trials of paroxetine for depression did not demonstrate statistical efficacy better than placebo. Discontinuing paroxetine is associated with a high risk of withdrawal syndrome. Due to the increased risk of birth defects, pregnant women or women planning to become pregnant are recommended to consult with their physician.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenobarbital	Phenobarbital	4763	DB01174	YQE403BP4D	50-06-6		Oral, rectal, parenteral	Hepatic	Phenobarbital is a barbiturate and the most widely used anticonvulsant worldwide, and the oldest still commonly used. It also has sedative and hypnotic properties, but as with other barbiturates, it has been superseded by the benzodiazepines for these indications. The World Health Organization recommends its use as first-line for partial and generalized tonicâ€“clonic seizures (those formerly known as grand mal) in developing countries. It is a core medicine in the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system. In more affluent countries, it is no longer recommended as a first- or second-line choice anticonvulsant for most seizure types, though it is still commonly used to treat neonatal seizures. Phenobarbital (and phenobarbital sodium) is manufactured and supplied in various forms: in tablets of 15, 30, 60 and 100Â mg; in an oral elixir (commonly 3Â mg/ml in strength); and in a form for injection (as phenobarbital sodium - usually 200Â mg/ml). The injectable form is used principally to control status epilepticus, while the oral forms are used for prophylactic and maintenance therapy. The dose range for epilepsy is 60â€“320Â mg/day; its very long active half-life means for some patients, doses do not have to be taken every day, particularly once the dose has been stabilised over a period of several weeks or months, and seizures are effectively controlled. It is occasionally still used as a sedative/hypnotic in anxious or agitated patients who may be intolerant of or do not have access to benzodiazepines, neuroleptics and other, newer drugs. For this purpose, phenobarbital has a lower dose range - around 30â€“120Â mg/day, but this practice is uncommon in developed countries.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sertraline	Sertraline	68617	DB01104	QUC7NX6WMB	79617-96-2		Oral	Hepatic	Sertraline hydrochloride (trade names Zoloft, Lustral) is an antidepressant of the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) class. It was introduced to the market by Pfizer in 1991. Sertraline is primarily used to treat major depressive disorder in adult outpatients as well as obsessiveâ€“compulsive, panic, and social anxiety disorders in both adults and children. In 2011, it was the second-most prescribed antidepressant on the U.S. retail market, with 37,208,000 prescriptions. The efficacy of sertraline for depression is similar to that of older tricyclic antidepressants, but its side effects are much less pronounced. Differences with newer antidepressants are subtler and also mostly confined to side effects. Evidence suggests that sertraline may work better than fluoxetine (Prozac) for some subtypes of depression. Sertraline is highly effective for the treatment of panic disorder, but cognitive behavioral therapy is a better treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder, whether by itself or in combination with sertraline. Although approved for social phobia and posttraumatic stress disorder, sertraline leads to only modest improvement in these conditions. Sertraline also alleviates the symptoms of premenstrual dysphoric disorder and can be used in sub-therapeutic doses or intermittently for its treatment. Sertraline shares the common side effects and contraindications of other SSRIs, with high rates of nausea, diarrhea, insomnia, and sexual side effects; however, it does not cause weight gain, and its effects on both cognition and vigilance are relatively mild.

First isolated in 1964, in its pure form, by Israeli scientists Raphael Mechoulam, Yechiel Gaoni and colleagues at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, it is a glassy solid when cold, and becomes viscous and sticky if warmed. A pharmaceutical formulation of THC, known by its INN dronabinol, is available by prescription in the U.S. and Canada under the brand name Marinol. An aromatic terpenoid, THC has a very low solubility in water, but good solubility in most organic solvents, specifically lipids and alcohols. Like most pharmacologically-active secondary metabolites of plants, THC in cannabis is assumed to be involved in self-defense, perhaps against herbivores. THC also possesses high UV-B (280-315Â nm) absorption properties, which, it has been speculated, could protect the plant from harmful UV radiation exposure.

Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram-(-), and Gram-(+) bacterial pathogens. Ciprofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are valued for this broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and for their availability in both oral and intravenous formulations. (Many antibacterials used in serious infections must be dosed intravenously. ) Ciprofloxacin is used alone or in combination with other antibacterial drugs in the empiric treatment of infections for which the bacterial pathogen has not been identified, including urinary tract infections and abdominal infections among others. It is also used for the treatment of infections caused by specific pathogens known to be sensitive. In 2010 over 20 million outpatient prescriptions were written for ciprofloxacin, making it the 35th most commonly prescribed drug, and the 5th most commonly prescribed antibacterial, in the US. It is a second-generation fluoroquinolone antibacterial. It kills bacteria by interfering with the enzymes that cause DNA to rewind after being copied, which stops synthesis of DNA and of protein. Ciprofloxacin was first patented in 1983 by Bayer A.G. and subsequently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1987. Ciprofloxacin has 12 FDA-approved human uses and other veterinary uses, but it is often used for unapproved uses (off-label).

Orciprenaline is a moderately selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist that stimulates receptors of the smooth muscle in the lungs, uterus, and vasculature supplying skeletal muscle, with minimal or no effect on alpha-adrenergic receptors. The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, such as orciprenaline, are at least in part attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of ATP to cAMP. Increased cAMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from many cells, especially from mast cells.

It is an analogue of fentanyl with around 1/4 the potency of fentanyl and around 1/3 of the duration of action, but with an onset of effects 4x faster than fentanyl. It is an agonist at mu opioid receptors. While alfentanil tends to cause fewer cardiovascular complications than other similar drugs such as fentanyl and remifentanil, it tends to give stronger respiratory depression and so requires careful monitoring of breathing and vital signs. Alfentanil is administered by the parenteral (injected) route for fast onset of effects and precise control of dosage. Alfentanil is a restricted drug which is classified as Schedule II in the USA, according to the U.S. DEA website. Alfentanil was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1976.

Under the trade-names (Survector, Maneon, Directim, Neolior, Provector, Viaspera) is used as an atypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that selectively inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and to a lesser extent norepinephrine, thus exerting a powerful and fast-acting antidepressant effect. Introduced in France in 1978 by the pharmaceutical company Servier and marketed under the trade name Survector, amineptine soon gained a reputation for abuse due to its short-lived, but pleasant, stimulant effect experienced by some patients. (This is to be distinguished from its antidepressant effect, which appears in approximately seven days after commencing treatment. ) After its release into the European market, cases of hepatotoxicity emerged, some serious. This, along with the potential for abuse, led to the suspension of the French marketing authorization for Survector in 1999. Amineptine was never approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for marketing in the United States, meaning that it is not legal to market or sell amineptine for any medical uses in the US.

In 2000, argatroban was licensed by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for prophylaxis or treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT). In 2002, it was approved for use during percutaneous coronary interventions in patients who have HIT or are at risk for developing it. in 2012, it was approved by the MHRA in the UK for anticoagulation in patients with Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia Type II(HIT) who require parenteral antithrombotic therapy. Argatroban is given intravenously and drug plasma concentrations reach steady state in 1-3 hours. Argatroban is metabolized in the liver and has a half-life of about 50 minutes. It is monitored by PTT. Because of its hepatic metabolism, it may be used in patients with renal dysfunction. (This is in contrast to lepirudin, a direct thrombin inhibitor that is primarily renally cleared).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atazanavir	Atazanavir	148192	DB01072	QZU4H47A3S	198904-31-3		Oral	Hepatic	Atazanavir (pronounced at a za na' veer), marketed under the trade name Reyataz by Bristol Myers, (formerly known as BMS-232632) is an antiretroviral drug of the protease inhibitor (PI) class. Like other antiretrovirals, it is used to treat infection of human immunodeficiency virus. Atazanavir is distinguished from other PIs in that it can be given once-daily (rather than requiring multiple doses per day) and has lesser effects on the patient's lipid profile (the amounts of cholesterol and other fatty substances in the blood). Like other protease inhibitors, it is used only in combination with other HIV medications. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved atazanavir on June 20, 2003. Atazanavir is the first PI approved for once-daily dosing, and also appears to be less likely to cause lipodystrophy and elevated cholesterol as side effects. It may also not be cross-resistant with other PIs. When boosted with ritonavir it is equivalent in potency to lopinavir for use in salvage therapy in patients with a degree of drug resistance, although boosting with ritonavir reduces the metabolic advantages of atazanavir. On October 20, 2006, the FDA approved a new formulation of atazanavir (300Â mg capsules) to be taken as part of combination drug therapy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Betaxolol	Betaxolol	2369	DB00195	O0ZR1R6RZ2	63659-18-7		oral, ocular	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Betaxolol (trade names Betoptic, Betoptic S, Lokren, Kerlone) is a selective beta1 receptor blocker used in the treatment of hypertension and glaucoma. Being selective for beta1 receptors, it typically has fewer systemic side effects than non-selective beta-blockers, for example, not causing bronchospasm (mediated by beta2 receptors) as timolol may. Betaxolol also shows greater affininty for beta1 receptors than metoprolol. In addition to its effect on the heart, betaxolol reduces the pressure within the eye. This effect is thought to be caused by reducing the production of the liquid (which is called the aqueous humor) within the eye. The precise mechanism of this effect is not known. The reduction in intraocular pressure reduces the risk of damage to the optic nerve and loss of vision in patients with elevated intraocular pressure due to glaucoma. Betaxolol was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for ocular use as a 0.5% solution (Betoptic) in 1985 and as a 0.25% solution (Betoptic S) in 1989.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bumetanide	Bumetanide	2471	DB00887	0Y2S3XUQ5H	28395-03-1		oral	hepatic	Bumetanide (trade names Bumex or Burinex) is a loop diuretic of the sulfamyl category to treat heart failure. It is often used in people in whom high doses of furosemide are ineffective. It is marketed by Hoffmann-La Roche. The main difference between the two substances is in bioavailability and pharmacodynamic potency. Furosemide is incompletely absorbed in the intestine (60%), and there is substantial inter- and intraindividual differences in bioavailability (range 10-90%). Bumetanide is almost completely absorbed (80%), and the absorption is not altered when it is taken with food. It is said to be a more predictable diuretic, meaning that the predictable absorption is reflected in a more predictable effect. Bumetanide is 40 times more potent than furosemide (for patients with normal renal function). In the brain, bumetanide blocks the NKCC1 cation-chloride co-transporter, and thus decreases internal chloride concentration in neurons. In turn, this concentration change makes the action of GABA more hyperpolarizing, which may be useful for treatment of neonatal seizures, that quite often are not responsive to traditional GABA-targeted treatment, such as barbiturates. Bumetanide is therefore currently under evaluation as a prospective antiepileptic drug.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bupropion	Bupropion	444	DB01156	01ZG3TPX31	34841-39-9		Oral	Hepaticâ€”important CYP2B6 and 2D6 involvement	Bupropion is an atypical antidepressant and smoking cessation aid. Its chemical name is 3-chloro-N-tert-butyl-Î²-ketoamphetamine, a substituted cathinone (Î²-ketoamphetamine), as well as substituted amphetamine. The drug therefore is a mild psychostimulant. Its primary pharmacological action is thought to be norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibition. It binds selectively to the dopamine transporter, but its behavioural effects have often been attributed to its inhibition of norepinephrine reuptake. It also acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. Bupropion belongs to the chemical class of aminoketones and is similar in structure to stimulants cathinone and diethylpropion, and to phenethylamines in general. Medically, bupropion serves as a non-tricyclic antidepressant fundamentally different to most commonly prescribed antidepressants such as SSRIs. Initially researched and marketed as an antidepressant, bupropion was subsequently found to be effective as a smoking cessation aid. With over 20 million retail prescriptions in 2007, it was the fourth-most prescribed antidepressant in the United States retail market after sertraline, escitalopram, and fluoxetine. Bupropion lowers seizure threshold, and its potential to cause seizures has been widely publicized. However, at the recommended dose, the risk of seizures is comparable to that observed for other antidepressants. Bupropion is an effective antidepressant on its own, but it is particularly popular as an add-on medication in the cases of incomplete response to the first-line selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant. In contrast to many other antidepressants, bupropion does not cause weight gain or sexual dysfunction; in most studies, groups placed on bupropion showed statistically significant increases in sexual functioning, and mild to moderate weight loss.

It is also used in biochemical experiments as an inhibitor of reductases. Dicoumarol is a natural chemical substance of combined plant and fungal origin. It is a derivative of coumarin, a bitter tasting but sweet-smelling substance made by plants that does not itself affect coagulation, but which is (classically) transformed in mouldy feeds or silages by a number of species of fungi, into active dicoumarol. Dicoumarol does affect coagulation, and was discovered in mouldy wet sweet-clover hay, as the cause of a naturally occurring bleeding disease in cattle. Identified in 1940, dicoumarol became the prototype of the 4-hydroxycoumarin derivative anticoagulant drug class. Dicoumarol itself, for a short time, was employed as a medicinal anticoagulant drug, but since the mid-1950s has been replaced by its simpler derivative warfarin, and other 4-hydroxycoumarin drugs. It is given orally, and it acts within two days.

Formerly used as an anesthetic agent, PCP exhibits hallucinogenic effects. First synthesized in 1926, it was eventually patented in 1952 by the Parke-Davis pharmaceutical company and marketed under the brand name Sernyl. In chemical structure, PCP is an arylcyclohexylamine derivative, and, in pharmacology, it is a member of the family of dissociative anesthetics. PCP works primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist, which blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor and, like most antiglutamatergic hallucinogens, is significantly more dangerous than other categories of hallucinogens. Other NMDA receptor antagonists include ketamine, tiletamine, dextromethorphan and nitrous oxide. As a recreational drug, PCP may be ingested, smoked, or inhaled.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitamin_C	Vitamin C	5785	DB00126	PQ6CK8PD0R	50-81-7		oral		"Vitamin C or -ascorbic acid, or simply ascorbate, is an essential nutrient for humans and certain other animal species. Vitamin C refers to a number of vitamers that have vitamin C activity in animals, including ascorbic acid and its salts, and some oxidized forms of the molecule like dehydroascorbic acid. Ascorbate and ascorbic acid are both naturally present in the body when either of these is introduced into cells, since the forms interconvert according to pH. Vitamin C is a cofactor in at least eight enzymatic reactions including several collagen synthesis reactions that, when dysfunctional, cause the most severe symptoms of scurvy. In animals, these reactions are especially important in wound-healing and in preventing bleeding from capillaries. Ascorbate may also act as an antioxidant against oxidative stress. However, the fact that the enantiomer -ascorbate (not found in nature) has identical antioxidant activity to -ascorbate, yet far less vitamin activity, underscores the fact that most of the function of -ascorbate as a vitamin relies not on its antioxidant properties, but upon enzymic reactions that are stereospecific. ""Ascorbate"" without the letter for the enantiomeric form is always presumed to be the chemical -ascorbate. Ascorbate (the anion of ascorbic acid) is required for a range of essential metabolic reactions in all animals and plants. It is made internally by almost all organisms; the main exceptions are bats, guinea pigs, capybaras, and the Anthropoidea. Ascorbate is also not synthesized by some species of birds and fish. All species that do not synthesize ascorbate require it in the diet. Deficiency in this vitamin causes the disease scurvy in humans.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cannabidiol	Cannabidiol	644019	none	19GBJ60SN5	13956-29-1				Cannabidiol (CBD) is a cannabinoid found in cannabis. It is a major constituent of the plant, representing up to 40% in its extracts. Compared to THC, cannabidiol, though psychoactive, is non-intoxicating, and is considered to have a wider scope of medical applications than THC, including to epilepsy, multiple sclerosis spasms, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and nausea. Cannabidiol has displayed sedative effects in animal tests. Some research, however, indicates that CBD can increase alertness. It may decrease the rate of THC clearance from the body, perhaps by interfering with the metabolism of THC in the liver. Medically, it has been shown to relieve convulsion, inflammation, anxiety, and nausea, as well as inhibit cancer cell growth. Recent studies have shown cannabidiol to be as effective as atypical antipsychotics in treating schizophrenia. Studies have also shown that it may relieve symptoms of dystonia. In November 2007, it was reported that CBD reduces growth of aggressive human breast cancer cells in vitro and reduces their invasiveness. A 2008 study published in the British Journal of Psychiatry showed significant differences in the Oxford-Liverpool Inventory of Feelings and Experiences scores between three groups: the first consisted of non-cannabis users, the second consisted of users with THC detected, and the third consisted of users with both THC and CBD detected. The THC only group scored significantly higher for unusual experiences than the THC and CBD group, whereas the THC and CBD group had significantly lower introvertive anhedonia scores than the THC only group and non-cannabis user group. This research indicates that CBD acts as an anti-psychotic and may counteract the potential psychotomimetic effects of THC on individuals with latent schizophrenia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methaqualone	Methaqualone	6292	DB04833	7ZKH8MQW6T	72-44-6				Methaqualone is a sedative-hypnotic drug that is similar in effect to barbiturates, a general central nervous system depressant. The sedative-hypnotic activity was first noted by Indian researchers in the 1950s and in 1962 methaqualone itself was patented in the US by Wallace and Tiernan. Its use peaked in the early 1970s as a hypnotic, for the treatment of insomnia, and as a sedative and muscle relaxant. It has also been used illegally as a recreational drug. Clandestinely produced methaqualone is seized by government agencies and police forces around the world. Methaqualone was first synthesized in India in 1951 by Indra Kishore Kacker and Syed Hussain Zaheer, and was soon introduced to Japanese and European consumers as a safe barbiturate substitute. By 1965 it was the most commonly prescribed sedative in Britain, where it has been sold legally under the names Malsed, Malsedin, and Renoval. In 1965 a Methaqualone/antihistamine combination was sold as the sedative drug Mandrax, by Roussel Laboratories (now part of Sanofi-Aventis). In 1972 it was the sixth-bestselling sedative in the USA, where it was legal under the brand name Quaalude.

It is taken orally, and is typically used for psoriasis. It is a metabolite of etretinate, which was used prior to the introduction of acitretin. Etretinate was discontinued because it had a narrow therapeutic index as well as a long elimination half-life (t1/2=120 days), making dosing difficult. In contrast, acitretin's half-life is approximately 2 days. Because acitretin can be reverse metabolised into etretinate which has a long half-life, women must avoid becoming pregnant for at least 3 years"">http://www. soriatane. com/patient/part. aspx) after discontinuing acitretin. Therefore, acitretin is generally not recommended for women of child-bearing age with a risk of becoming pregnant. Acitretin is the oral retinoid of choice used in the treatment of severe resistant psoriasis. It binds to nuclear receptors that regulates gene transcription. They induce keratinocyte differentiation and reduce epidermal hyperplasia, leading to the slowing of cell reproduction. Acitretin is readily absorbed and widely distributed after oral administration. A therapeutic effect occurs after 2 to 4 weeks or longer. If a patient has received the medication, he/she is advised against giving blood for at least 3 years due to the risk of birth defects (AABB Technical Manual)."

It costs Â£400,000 (US$600,000) per year per patient. Eculizumab also is the first agent approved for the treatment of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), an ultra-rare genetic disease that causes abnormal blood clots to form in small blood vessels throughout the body, leading to kidney failure, damage to other vital organs and premature death. In clinical trials in patients with PNH, eculizumab was associated with reductions in chronic hemolysis, thromboembolic events, and transfusion requirements, as well as improvements in PNH symptoms, quality of life, and survival. Clinical trials in patients with aHUS demonstrated inhibition of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA), the formation of blood clots in small blood vessels throughout the body, including normalization of platelets and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), as well as maintenance or improvement in renal function. Eculizumab was discovered and developed by Alexion Pharmaceuticals and is manufactured by Alexion. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on March 16, 2007 for the treatment of PNH, and on September 23, 2011 for the treatment of aHUS. It was approved by the European Medicines Agency for the treatment of PNH on June 20, 2007, and on November 24, 2011 for the treatment of aHUS. Eculizumab is currently being investigated as a potential treatment for other severe, ultra-rare disorders.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adalimumab	Adalimumab		DB00051	FYS6T7F842	331731-18-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subcutaneous_injection		"Adalimumab is the third TNF inhibitor, after infliximab and etanercept, to be approved in the United States. Like infliximab and etanercept, adalimumab binds to Tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNFÎ±), preventing it from activating TNF receptors. Adalimumab was constructed from a fully human monoclonal antibody, while infliximab is a mouse-human chimeric antibody and etanercept is a TNF receptor-IgG fusion protein. TNFÎ± inactivation has proven to be important in downregulating the inflammatory reactions associated with autoimmune diseases. As of 2008 adalimumab has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, Crohn's disease, moderate to severe chronic psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Although only approved for ulcerative colitis from late 2012 by the FDA in the disease's management, it has been used for several years in cases that have not responded to conventional treatment at standard dosing for Crohn's Disease. However, because TNFÎ± is part of the immune system that protects the body from infection, prolonged treatment with adalimumab may slightly increase the risk of developing infections. HUMIRA (""Human Monoclonal Antibody in Rheumatoid Arthritis"") is marketed in both preloaded 0.8 mL syringes and also in preloaded pen devices (called Humira Pen), both injected subcutaneously, typically by the patient at home. For subcutaneous injection, the injection sites should be rotated. If solution is discolored do not use. Individuals with latex allergies must take caution as the needle caps of the pre-filled syringe may contain latex. It cannot be administered orally because the digestive system would destroy the drug. Adalimumab was the first fully human monoclonal antibody drug approved by the FDA. It was derived from phage display, and was discovered through a collaboration between BASF Bioresearch Corporation (Worcester, Massachusetts, a unit of BASF) and Cambridge Antibody Technology as D2E7, then further manufactured at BASF Bioresearch Corporation and developed by BASF Knoll (BASF Pharma) and, ultimately, manufactured and marketed by Abbott Laboratories after the acquisition of BASF Pharma by Abbott. In 2009, HUMIRA had over $5 billion in annual sales. , whilst in 2012 the drug reached $4.3 billion of sales in the US alone, achieving $9.3 billion in worldwide sales for that year."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aprotinin	Aprotinin		DB06692	04XPW8C0FL	9087-70-1		Intravenous		The drug aprotinin, is the bovine version of the small protein bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor, or BPTI, which inhibits trypsin and related proteolytic enzymes. Under the trade name Trasylol, aprotinin was used as a medication administered by injection to reduce bleeding during complex surgery, such as heart and liver surgery. Its main effect is the slowing down of fibrinolysis, the process that leads to the breakdown of blood clots. The aim in its use was to decrease the need for blood transfusions during surgery, as well as end-organ damage due to hypotension (low blood pressure) as a result of marked blood loss. The drug was temporarily withdrawn worldwide in 2007 after studies suggested that its use increased the risk of complications or death; this was confirmed by follow-up studies. Trasylol sales were suspended in May 2008, except for very restricted research use. In February 2012 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) scientific committee reverted its previous standpoint regarding aprotinin, and has recommended that the suspension be lifted.

It is also used off-label by individuals wishing to avoid fatigue, such as night workers or others who need to stay awake and alert for long periods of time. Adrafinil is a prodrug; it is primarily metabolized in vivo to modafinil, resulting in nearly identical pharmacological effects. Unlike modafinil, however, it takes time for the metabolite to accumulate to active levels in the bloodstream. Effects usually are apparent within 45â€“60 minutes when taken orally on an empty stomach. Adrafinil does not currently have FDA approval and is thus unregulated in the United States. It was marketed in France and elsewhere in Europe under the trade name Olmifon until September 2011 when France's FDA equivalent reassessed the drug and withdrew marketing permission.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sugammadex	Sugammadex	6918584		361LPM2T56	343306-79-6		Intravenous		"Sugammadex (designation Org 25969, tradename Bridion) is an agent for reversal of neuromuscular blockade by the agent rocuronium in general anaesthesia. It is the first selective relaxant binding agent (SRBA) and was discovered at the Newhouse research site in Scotland. These scientists who discovered Sugammadex worked for the pharmaceutical company, Organon. Organon was acquired by Schering-Plough in 2007; Schering-Plough merged with Merck in 2009. Sugammadex is now owned and sold by Merck. On January 3, 2008, Schering-Plough submitted a New Drug Application to the US Food and Drug Administration for sugammadex, but the FDA rejected the application on August 2008. It was approved for use in the European Union on July 29, 2008. Sugammadex is a modified Î³-cyclodextrin, with a lipophilic core and a hydrophilic periphery. This gamma cyclodextrin has been modified from its natural state by placing eight carboxyl thio ether groups at the sixth carbon positions. These extensions extend the cavity size allowing greater encapsulation of the rocuronium molecule. These negatively charged extensions electrostatically bind to the positively charged ammonium group as well as contribute to the aqueous nature of the cyclodextrin. Sugammadex's binding encapsulation of rocuronium is one of the strongest among cyclodextrins and their guest molecules. The rocuronium molecule bound within sugammadex's lipophilic core, is rendered unavailable to bind to the acetylcholine receptor at the neuromuscular junction. Left: Schematic of a sugammadex molecule encapsulating a rocuronium molecule. Right: Space-filling model of a sugammadex sodium molecule in the same orientation. The main advantage of sugammadex is reversal of neuromuscular blockade without relying on inhibition of acetylcholinesterase. Therefore it does not cause the autonomic instability produced by anticholinesterases such as neostigmine, and antimuscarinic agents such as atropine do not need to be co-administered. Its administration is therefore associated with much greater cardiovascular and autonomic stability than the traditional reversal agents. In addition, when a fast onset and short duration of muscle relaxant is required, there has been little choice previously apart from the use of suxamethonium. However, suxamethonium is not ideal, as it has some undesirable side effects, such as anaphylaxis, increasing serum potassium levels and other cardiovascular properties. Since, in high doses, rocuronium has a reasonably rapid onset and now can be reversed with sugammadex, it can potentially be used instead. 'Recurarisation', a phenomenon of recurrence of neuromuscular block, may occur where the reversal agents wear off before a neuromuscular blocking drug is completely cleared. This is very unusual with all but the longest acting neuromuscular blocking drugs. It has been demonstrated to occur only rarely with sugammadex, and only when insufficient doses were administered. The underlying mechanism is thought to be related to redistribution of relaxant after reversal. It may occur for a limited range of sugammadex doses which are sufficient for complex formation with relaxant in the central compartment, but insufficient for additional relaxant returning to central from peripheral compartments. Sugammadex also has some affinity for other aminosteroid neuromuscular blocking agents such as vecuronium and pancuronium. Though sugammadex's affinity for vecuronium is lower than its affinity for rocuronium, reversal of vecuronium is still effective because fewer vecuronium molecules are present in vivo for equivalent blockade. Vecuronium is approximately seven times more potent than rocuronium and overall requires fewer molecules to induce blockade. Sugammadex encapsulates with a 1:1 ratio and therefore will adequately reverse vecuronium as there are fewer molecules to bind compared to rocuronium. Shallow Pancuronium blockade has been successfully reversed by sugammadex in phase III clinical trials. A study was carried out in Europe looking at its suitability in rapid sequence induction. It found that sugammadex provides a rapid and dose-dependent reversal of neuromuscular blockade induced by high-dose rocuronium. A Cochrane systematic review on sugammadex has been recently published by Abrishami et al. This review article included 18 randomized controlled trials on the efficacy and safety of sugammadex. The trials included a total of 1321 patients. The review concluded that ""sugammadex was shown to be more effective than placebo (no medication) or neostigmine in reversing muscle relaxation caused by neuromuscular blockade during surgery and is relatively safe. Serious complications occurred in less than 1% of the patients who received sugammadex. The results of this review article (especially the safety results) need to be confirmed by future trials on larger patient populations""."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fidaxomicin	Fidaxomicin	11528171		Z5N076G8YQ	873857-62-6		Oral		Fidaxomicin (trade names Dificid, Dificlir, and previously OPT-80 and PAR-101) is the first in a new class of narrow spectrum macrocyclic antibiotic drugs. It is a fermentation product obtained from the actinomycete Dactylosporangium aurantiacum subspecies hamdenesis. Fidaxomicin is non-systemic, meaning it is minimally absorbed into the bloodstream, it is bactericidal, and it has demonstrated selective eradication of pathogenic Clostridium difficile with minimal disruption to the multiple species of bacteria that make up the normal, healthy intestinal flora. The maintenance of normal physiological conditions in the colon can reduce the probability of Clostridium difficile infection recurrence. It is marketed by Optimer Pharmaceuticals for treatment of Clostridium difficile infection. Fidaxomicin is available in a 200Â mg tablet that is administered every 12 hours for a recommended duration of 10 days. Total duration of therapy should be determined by the patient's clinical status.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gabapentin_enacarbil	Gabapentin enacarbil	9883933		75OCL1SPBQ	478296-72-9		Oral		Gabapentin enacarbil (Horizant, Regnite, formerly known as XP-13512) is a prodrug for the anticonvulsant and analgesic drug gabapentin. It was designed for increased oral bioavailability over gabapentin, and human trials showed it to produce extended release of gabapentin with almost twice the overall bioavailability, especially when taken with a fatty meal. Gabapentin enacarbil has passed human clinical trials for the treatment of restless legs syndrome, and initial results have shown it to be well tolerated and reasonably effective. Gabapentin enacarbil was denied approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in February 2010, citing concerns about possible increased cancer risk shown by some animal studies. Similar concerns had been raised about gabapentin itself in the past, but were felt to be outweighed by its clinical utility as an anticonvulsant, whereas the treatment of restless legs syndrome was not seen to justify the same kind of risk. On April 6, 2011, Xenoport received FDA approval for Horizant (gabapentin enacarbil) for the treatment of moderate-to-severe restless legs syndrome. On June 7, 2012, FDA approved Horizant for the treatment of postherpetic neuralgia in adults.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imipraminoxide	Imipraminoxide	65589		8MKS280XJW	6829-98-7		oral		Imipraminoxide (Imiprex, Elepsin), or imipramine N-oxide, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) that was introduced in Europe in the 1960s for the treatment of depression. Imipraminoxide is both an analogue and a metabolite of imipramine, and has similar effects. However, in clinical trials, imipraminoxide was found to have a faster onset of action, slightly higher efficacy, and fewer and less marked side effects, including diminished orthostatic hypotension and anticholinergic effects like dry mouth, sweating, dizziness, and fatigue. Imipraminoxide's pharmacology has not been well elucidated, but based on its very close relationship with imipramine, it likely acts as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor and serotonin, adrenenaline, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist, though with weaker antiadrenergic and anticholinergic actions.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Laudexium_metilsulfate	Laudexium metilsulfate	18618		D067KDG4NU	3253-60-9		IV		Laudexium metilsulfate is a neuromuscular blocking drug or skeletal muscle relaxant in the category of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs, used adjunctively in surgical anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Laudexium is no longer used in clinical practice, though it was introduced clinically in the early 1950s. It has about half the potency, a slower onset of action and a duration of action much longer than that of d-tubocurarine. As with all clinically established (as well as experimental agents) with a non-depolarizing mechanism of action, its pharmacological action can be antagonized by anticholinesterases. The displacement of laudexium from clinical use was assured owing to recurrent reports of significant post-operative re-curarization.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pimavanserin	Pimavanserin	10071196		JZ963P0DIK	706779-91-1		Oral		Pimavanserin (ACP-103) is a drug developed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals which acts as an inverse agonist on the serotonin receptor subtype 5-HT2A, with 10x selectivity over 5-HT2C, and no significant affinity or activity at 5-HT2B or dopamine receptors. As of September 3 2009, pimavanserin has not met expectations for Phase III clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease psychosis, and is in Phase II trials for adjunctive treatment of schizophrenia alongside an antipsychotic medication. It is expected to improve the effectiveness and side effect profile of antipsychotics.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Teniloxazine	Teniloxazine	119114		95Q6WNP25P	62473-79-4		Oral		Teniloxazine (Lucelan, Metatone), also known as sufoxazine/sulfoxazine, is a drug which is marketed in Japan. Though initially investigated as a neuroprotective and nootropic agent for the treatment of cerebrovascular insufficiency in the 1980s, it was ultimately developed and approved as an antidepressant instead. It acts as a potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with fair selectivity over the serotonin and dopamine transporters, and also behaves as an antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vabicaserin	Vabicaserin	11658860		WD9550HPNL	620948-34-7		Oral		Vabicaserin (SCA-136) was a novel antipsychotic and anorectic under development by Wyeth. As of 2010 it is no longer in clinical trials for the treatment of psychosis. It was also under investigation as an antidepressant but this indication appears to have been dropped as well. Vabicaserin acts as a selective 5-HT2C receptor full agonist (Ki = 3 nM; EC50 = 8 nM; IA = 100%) and 5-HT2B receptor antagonist (IC50 = 29 nM). It is also a very weak antagonist at the 5-HT2A receptor (IC50 = 1,650 nM), though this action is not clinically significant. By activating 5-HT2C receptors, vabicaserin inhibits dopamine release in the mesolimbic pathway, likely underlying its efficacy in alleviating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and increases acetylcholine and glutamate levels in the prefrontal cortex, suggesting benefits against cognitive symptoms as well.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desomorphine	Desomorphine	5362456		7OP86J5E33	427-00-9				Desomorphine (dihydrodesoxymorphine, Permonid) is an opioid invented in 1932 in the United States that is a derivative of morphine, where the 6-hydroxyl group has been removed and the 7,8 double bond has been reduced. It has sedative and analgesic effects, and is around 8-10 times more potent than morphine. It was used in Switzerland under the brand name Permonid, and was described as having a fast onset and a short duration of action, with relatively little nausea or respiratory depression compared to equivalent doses of morphine. The traditional synthesis of desomorphine starts from Î±-chlorocodide, which is itself obtained by reacting thionyl chloride with codeine. By catalytic reduction, Î±-chlorocodide gives dihydrodesoxycodeine, which yields desomorphine on demethylation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talsaclidine	Talsaclidine	71792		1O8VSL798T	147025-53-4				Talsaclidine (WAL-2014) is a non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist which acts as a full agonist at the M1 subtype, and as a partial agonist at the M2 and M3 subtypes. It was under development for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease but showed only modest or poor efficacy in rhesus monkeys and humans, respectively, perhaps due to an array of dose-limiting side effects including increased heart rate and blood pressure, increased salivation, urinary frequency and burning upon urination, increased lacrimation and nasal secretion, abnormal accommodation, heartburn, upset stomach as well as cramps, nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, excessive sweating and palpitations.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Methoxyestradiol	2-Methoxyestradiol	66414		6I2QW73SR5	362-07-2				2-Methoxyestradiol (2ME2) is a natural metabolite of estradiol. As an experimental drug candidate, it is being developed under the tradename of Panzem. It prevents the formation of new blood vessels that tumors need in order to grow, hence it is an angiogenesis inhibitor. It also acts as a vasodilator. 2ME2 is derived from estrogen, although it binds poorly to known estrogen receptors. It induces apoptosis in some cancer cell lines. It has undergone Phase 1 clinical trials against breast cancer. A phase II trial of 18 advanced ovarian cancer patients reported encouraging results in Oct 2007. Preclinical models also suggest that 2ME2 could also be effective against inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Several studies have been conducted showing 2ME2 is a microtubule-inhibitor and effective against prostate cancer in rodents. The CAS name for 2ME2 is (17 beta)-2-methoxyestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-3,17-diol.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amorolfine	Amorolfine	54260		AB0BHP2FH0	78613-35-1				Amorolfine (or amorolfin), is a morpholine antifungal drug that inhibits D14 reductase and D7-D8 isomerase, which depletes ergosterol and causes ignosterol to accumulate in the fungal cytoplasmic cell membranes. Marketed as Curanail, Loceryl, Locetar, and Odenil, amorolfine is commonly available in the form of a nail lacquer, containing 5% amorolfine as the active ingredient. It is used to treat onychomycosis (fungal infection of the toe- and fingernails). Amorolfine 5% nail lacquer in once-weekly or twice-weekly applications has been shown in two studies to be between 60% and 71% effective in treating toenail onychomycosis; complete cure rates three months after stopping treatment (after six months of treatment) were 38% and 46%. However, full experimental details of these trials were not available and since they were first reported in 1992 there have been no subsequent trials. It is a topical solution for the treatment of toenail infections. Systemic treatments may be considered more effective. It is approved for sale over the counter in Australia and the UK (recently re-classified to over the counter status), and is approved for the treatment of toenail fungus by prescription in other countries. It is not approved for the treatment of onychomycosis in the United States or Canada, but can be ordered from there by mail from other countries.

It functions by activating the melanocortin receptors MC1R and MC4R, to modulate inflammation and limiting ischemia. It was originally tested for intranasal administration in treating female sexual dysfunction but this application was temporarily discontinued in 2008 after concerns were raised over adverse side effects of increased blood pressure. As of March, 2012, Palatin is conducting a human Phase 2B study using a new subcutaneous drug delivery system that appears to have little effect on blood pressure.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celiprolol	Celiprolol	2663		DRB57K47QC	56980-93-9				Celiprolol (brand names Cardem, Selectol, Celipres, Celipro, Celol, Cordiax, Dilanorm) is a medication in the class of beta blockers, used in the treatment of high blood pressure. It has a unique pharmacology: it is a selective Î²1 receptor antagonist, but a Î²2 receptor partial agonist. It is also a weak Î±2 receptor antagonist. A recent clinical trial has suggested a use for this medication in the prevention of vascular complications of a rare inherited disease called vascular Ehlersâ€“Danlos syndrome. This study demonstrated decreased incidence of arterial rupture or dissection (a specific type of arterial rupture in which the layers of the vessel separate prior to complete failure of the artery wall).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ciglitazone	Ciglitazone	2750		U8QXS1WU8G	74772-77-3				Ciglitazone is a thiazolidinedione. Developed by Takeda Pharmaceuticals in the early 1980s, it is considered the prototypical compound for the thiazolidinedione class. Ciglitazone was never used as a medication, but it sparked interest in the effects of thiazolidinediones. Several analogues were later developed, some of whichâ€”such as pioglitazone and troglitazoneâ€”made it to the market. Ciglitazone significantly decreases VEGF production by human granulosa cells in an in vitro study, and may potentially be used in ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. Ciglitazone is a potent and selective PPARÎ³ ligand. It binds to the PPARÎ³ ligand-binding domain with an EC50 of 3.0 ÂµM. Ciglitazone is active in vivo as an anti-hyperglycemic agent in the ob/ob murine model. Inhibits HUVEC differentiation and angiogenesis and also stimulates adipogenesis and decreases osteoblastogenesis in human mesenchymal stem cells.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Citicoline	Citicoline	13805		536BQ2JVC7	987-78-0				Citicoline, also known as cytidine diphosphate-choline (CDP-Choline) & cytidine 5'-diphosphocholine is a psychostimulant/nootropic. It is an intermediate in the generation of phosphatidylcholine from choline. Studies suggest that CDP-choline supplements increase dopamine receptor densities, and suggest that CDP-choline supplementation helps prevent memory impairment resulting from poor environmental conditions. Preliminary research has found that citicoline supplements help improve focus and mental energy and may possibly be useful in the treatment of attention deficit disorder. Citicoline has also been shown to elevate ACTH independently from CRH levels and to amplify the release of other HPA axis hormones such as LH, FSH, GH and TSH in response to hypothalamic releasing factors. These effects on HPA hormone levels may be beneficial for some individuals but may have undesirable effects in those with medical conditions featuring ACTH or cortisol hypersecretion including, but not limited to, PCOS, type II diabetes and major depressive disorder.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atacicept	Atacicept			K3D9A0ICQ3	845264-92-8				"Atacicept is a recombinant fusion protein designed to inhibit B cells, thereby suppressing autoimmune disease. The designer protein combines the binding site for two cytokines that regulate maturation, function, and survival of B cells, B-lymphocyte stimulator (BLyS) and a proliferation-inducing ligand (APRIL), with the constant region of immunoglobin. Atacicept blocks activation of B cells by the tumor necrosis factor receptor superfamily member 13B (more commonly known as TACI), a transmembrane receptor protein found predominantly on the surface of B cells. Like the monoclonal antibody belimumab, atacicept blocks the binding of BLyS, but it also blocks APRIL. Binding of these TACI ligands induces proliferation, activation, and longevity of B cells and thus their production of autoantibodies. Atacicept is thought to selectively impair mature B cells and plasma cells with less impact on progenitor cells and memory B cells. Studies have looked at atacicept in animal models of autoimmune disease and in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and optic neuritis. A phase II/III trial for systemic lupus erythematosus is due to run from 2008 to 2012. The subcutaneously injected protein failed a phase II trial for multiple sclerosis. The trials of atacicept in people with MS were suspended when some people taking the drug in one trial had an unexpected increase in inflammatory activity. An independent data monitoring board for the MS study found ""subjects receiving atacicept were having more relapses and new MRI lesions than those on the placebo. "" The drug is also being studied for treatment of B-cell malignancies, including multiple myeloma, B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Atacicept was developed by a Seattle-based biotech company, ZymoGenetics, which handed the product over to Merck Serono for further development."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cipralisant	Cipralisant	10512919		309713XSKW					Cipralisant (GT-2331, tentative trade name Perceptin) is an extremely potent Histamine H3 receptor ligand originally developed by Gliatech. Cipralisant was initially classified as a selective H3 antagonist, and seemed to be well tolerated during early testing, entering Phase II trials for ADHD in 2000. The relatively recent cloning of human H3 receptor, as well as the discovery of its constitutive activity provided the ability to better assess the activity of H3 receptor ligands. Consequently cipralisant was reassessed as an H3 receptor agonist in human and rat recombinant systems, showing functional selectivity and stimulating one type of G-protein coupled pathway while failing to activate other intracellular pathways. Gliatech filed for bankruptcy in 2002, and its intellectual property was inherited by Merck. The development of cipralisant seems to have been suspended since 2003 but research is ongoing, and recently it has been shown that it is the 1S,2S enantiomer which is the biologically active one.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Melanocyte-inhibiting_factor	Melanocyte-inhibiting factor	3896043			2002-44-0		IV	plasma protease enzymes	Melanocyte-inhibiting factor is an endogenous peptide fragment derived from cleavage of the hormone oxytocin, but having generally different actions in the body. MIF-1 produces multiple effects, both blocking the effects of opioid receptor activation, while at the same time acting as a positive allosteric modulator of the D2 and D4 dopamine receptor subtypes, as well as inhibiting release of other neuropeptides such as alpha-MSH, and potentiating melatonin activity. This complex mix of actions produces a profile of antidepressant, nootropic, and anti-Parkinsonian effects when MIF-1 is administered, and it has been investigated for various medical uses. MIF-1 is unusually resistant to metabolism in the bloodstream, and crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier easily, though it is poorly active orally and is usually injected.

Slang names include drone and MCAT. It is reportedly manufactured in China and is chemically similar to the cathinone compounds found in the khat plant of eastern Africa. It comes in the form of tablets or a powder, which users can swallow, snort or inject, producing similar effects to MDMA, amphetamines and cocaine. As well as producing stimulant effects, negative side effects occur when mephedrone is used, with teeth grinding the most common. The metabolism of mephedrone has been studied in rats and humans and the metabolites can be detected in urine after usage. Nothing is known about its potential neurotoxicity but scientists have suggested possible dangers associated with its use based on its similarity to other drugs. Several people have died after consuming mephedrone but some deaths the media attributed to the drug were later determined to have been caused by other factors. Mephedrone was first synthesised in 1929, but did not become widely known until it was rediscovered in 2003. By 2007, mephedrone was reported to be available for sale on the internet, by 2008 law enforcement agencies had become aware of the compound, and by 2010, it had been reported in most of Europe, becoming particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom. Mephedrone was first made illegal in Israel in 2008, followed by Sweden later that year. In 2010, it was made illegal in many European countries and in December 2010, the EU ruled it illegal. In Australia, New Zealand and the USA, it is considered an analog of other illegal drugs and can be controlled by laws similar to the Federal Analog Act. In September 2011, the USA temporarily classified mephedrone as illegal, in effect from October 2011.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine	3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine	91253			87179-33-7		Oral		3-Methoxy-4-methylamphetamine (MMA) is an entactogen and psychedelic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes. It was first synthesized in 1970 and was encountered as a street drug in Italy in the same decade. MMA was largely forgotten until being reassayed by David E. Nichols as a non-neurotoxic MDMA analogue in 1991, and has subsequently been sold as a designer drug on the internet since the late 2000s (decade). In animal studies, MMA fully substitutes for MDMA and MBDB, partially substitutes for LSD, and does not substitute for amphetamine. Additionally, it has been shown to potently inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and does not produce serotonergic neurotoxicity in rodents. These data appear to confer a profile of MMA as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) and 5-HT2A receptor agonist. According to anecdotal reports, MMA is active in humans at doses of 20â€“60Â mg and possesses a duration of approximately 12â€“16 hours. It is said to produce empathy and mild 2C-like psychedelic effects, and although it is mood-lifting, it is not euphoric like MDMA and is more antidepressant-like in comparison. At higher doses, such as 120Â mg, the effects are much more psychedelic but can be dysphoric and very long-lived.

Nichols at Purdue University. It acts as a non-neurotoxic and highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) in animals and a putative entactogen in humans.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/6-APDB	6-APDB	192599			152623-93-3		Oral		6-(2-Aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (6-APDB, 4-Desoxy-MDA, EMA-3) is a stimulant and entactogen drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes. It is an analogue of MDA where the heterocyclic 4-position oxygen from the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring has been replaced with a methylene bridge. 5-APDB (3-Desoxy-MDA) is an analogue of 6-APDB where the 3-position oxygen has been replaced with a methylene instead. 6-APDB, along with 5-APDB, was first synthesized by David E. Nichols in the early 1990s while investigating non-neurotoxic MDMA analogues. In animal studies, 6-APDB fully substitutes for MBDB and MMAI but not for amphetamine or LSD. In vitro, 6-APDB has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine with IC50 values of 322 nM, 1,997 nM, and 980 nM, respectively. These values are very similar to those of MDA, but with those for the catecholamines slightly lower in comparison, perhaps more similarly to MDMA. In contrast, 5-APDB is highly selective for serotonin. Though 6-APDB does not substitute for amphetamine in rats at the doses used in referenced study, based on its in vitro profile it can be suggested that it may have amphetamine-like effects at higher doses. The unsaturated benzofuran derivative 6-APB, or 6-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran is also known, but the difference in pharmacological effects between 6-APB and 6-APDB is unclear.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/8-Carboxamidocyclazocine	8-Carboxamidocyclazocine	10086063			911207-68-6				8-Carboxamidocyclazocine (8-CAC) is an opioid analgesic drug related to cyclazocine, invented by the chemist Mark P. Wentland and co-workers. Similarly to cyclazocine, 8-CAC acts as an agonist at both the Î¼ and Îº opioid receptors, but has a much longer duration of action than cyclazocine, and does not have Î¼ antagonist activity. Unexpectedly it was discovered that the phenolic hydroxyl group of cyclazocine could be replaced by a carboxamido group with only slight loss of potency at opioid receptors, and this discovery has subsequently been used to develop a large number of novel opioid derivatives where the phenolic hydroxy group has been replaced by either carboxamide or a variety of larger groups. Due to their strong Îº-opioid agonist activity, these drugs are not suited for use as analgesics in humans, but have instead been researched as potential drugs for the treatment of cocaine addiction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/8-Phenyltheophylline	8-Phenyltheophylline	1922			961-45-5				8-Phenyltheophylline (8-Phenyl-1,3-dimethylxanthine, 8-PT) is a drug derived from the xanthine family which acts as a potent and selective antagonist for the adenosine receptors A1 and A2A, but unlike other xanthine derivatives has virtually no activity as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor. It has stimulant effects in animals with similar potency to caffeine. Coincidentally 8-phenyltheophylline has also been found to be a potent and selective inhibitor of the liver enzyme CYP1A2 which makes it likely to cause interactions with other drugs which are normally metabolised by CYP1A2.

HHC is active in its own right with similar potency to THC, but further simplification and variation of this parent structure lead to more potent, yet structurally simpler derivatives such as CP 47,497 and CP 55,940, which after several steps of modification have become quite structurally distinct from THC, while HHC on the other hand is still substantially similar in structure to THC. The discovery of this simplified class of cannabinoid derivatives was highly significant in terms of the widespread use of CP 55,940 for early scientific research into the cannabinoid receptors, as well as later work using more complex compounds such as CP 55,244 to map the CB1 binding site in more detail, but aside from these specific applications, these compounds attracted little attention and no compounds from this series were developed for medical use despite favourable safety profiles in animal studies. Unexpectedly, some 25 years later, these compounds came back into prominence when an obscure derivative (C8)-CP 47,497 was found to have been sold as the active ingredient in the ""herbal"" cannabis substitute product Spice, which ironically has led to a resurgence of interest into laboratory-conducted scientific research of this family of drugs."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Betaenone_B	Betaenone B	158750			85269-23-4				Betaenone B, like other betaenones, is a secondary metabolite isolated from the fungus Pleospora betae, a plant pathogen. Its phytotoxic properties have been shown to cause sugar beet leaf spots, which is characterized by black, pycnidia containing, concentric circles eventually leading to necrosis of the leaf tissue. Of the seven phytotoxins isolated in fungal leaf spots from sugar beet (Beta vulgaris), betaenone B showed the least amount of phytotoxicity showing only 8% inhibition of growth while betaenone A and C showed 73% and 89% growth inhibition, respectively. Betaenone B is therefore not considered toxic to the plant, but will produce leaf spots when present in high concentrations (0.33Â Âµg/ÂµL). While the mechanism of action of betaenone B has yet to be elucidated, betaenone C has been shown to inhibit RNA and protein synthesis. Most of the major work on betaenone B, including the initial structure elucidation of betaenone A, B and C as well as the partial elucidation mechanism of biosynthesis, was presented in three short papers published between 1983â€“88. The compounds were found to inhibit a variety of protein kinases signifying a possible role in cancer treatment. The structure of betaenone B was determined via nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), CD and optical rotatory dispersion (ORD) measurements. While it was also shown that that betaenone B could be converted to betaenone A by oxidation by PCC followed by exposure to base, it wasn't until 1988 that a semi-complete total synthesis was reported. Using 1,3-butadiene as a starting material, a stereoselective synthesis of (+/-)-4-de(3'-hydroxypropionyl) betanenone B was achieved in a 24-step synthesis. Bioactivity of this synthetic product was not tested and no further work on total synthesis of betaenones has been published since. While a complete de novo synthesis of betaenone B has yet to be reported, Daniel Pratt and Paul Hopkins in 1988 proposed a method for synthesizing a precursor of betaenone B from methoxybenzoquinone and 1,3-butadiene via a Dielsâ€“Alder reaction and Claisen chemistry.

However, due to its relatively poor selectivity for the Îº-opioid receptor over the Î¼- and Î´-opioid receptors (of which it has approximately 80% and 20% of the affinity for, respectively, in comparison), as well as its relatively poor intrinsic activity at all sites, it has been mostly replaced in recent times by newer and more potent and selective compounds like U-50,488 and ICI-199,441.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/O-1269	O-1269	9868408			336615-64-6				O-1269 is a drug that is a diarylpyrazole derivative, related to potent cannabinoid antagonist drugs such as rimonabant and surinabant. However O-1269 and several related drugs were unexpectedly found to act as full or partial agonists at the cannabinoid receptors rather than antagonists, and so produce the usual effects expected of cannabinoid agonists in animal tests, such as sedation and analgesic effects. The N-heptyl homologue O-1270 and the N-propyl homologue O-1399 also act as cannabinoid agonists with similar potency in vivo, despite weaker binding affinity at cannabinoid receptors compared to the pentyl homologue O-1269. Agonist-like and atypical cannabinoid activity has also been observed with a number of related compounds.

A further advantage, in addition to potency of this compound, is that its duration of activity is longer than for cocaine. It could therefore be considered within the context as an agonist based therapy for treating cocaine addiction, although it is actually RTI-336 that entered into clinical trials with this in mind. RTI-31 is already completely psychoactive in its own right meaning that further chemical manipulation should be viewed as an option that is not strictly necessary. RTI-336 is actually made using RTI-31 as starting material. As will be seen in the next section, RTI-31 is not an entirely selective DRI in that it also has appreciable SERT and NET blocking affinity. RTI-31 can easily be ""cleaned"" though, as is done, for instance, by replacing the carbomethoxy ester with a more sterically occluded substituent such as is done for RTI-113."

With a binding affinity (Ki) of 55 nM at DAT and 28.4 nM at SERT but only 4030 nM at NET, RTI-83 has reasonable selectivity for DAT/SERT over NET, but further research has shown that by extending the ethyl chain even better selectivity can be achieved, with the 4-(cis-propenyl) analogue having Ki values of 15 nM at DAT and 7.1 nM at SERT, vs 28,000 nM at NET. Such drugs are speculated to be useful as potential antidepressants, but few examples have been reported in the literature as yet. However while RTI-83 has been used for binding studies to model the monoamine transporter proteins, its pharmacology in vivo has not been studied in detail.

This endophyte is likely the cause of the decline of Florida torreya, an endangered species that is related to the taxol-producing Taxus brevifolia. The natural product was found to be cytotoxic against 25 different human cancer cell lines with an average IC50 value of 9.4Â Âµg/mL, ranging from 3.5 (NEC) to 45 (A549) Âµg/mL. Torreyanic acid was found to be 5-10 times more potent in cell lines sensitive to protein kinase C (PKC) agonists, 12-o-tetradecanoyl phorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and was shown to cause cell death via apoptosis. Torreyanic acid also promoted G1 arrest of G0 cynchronized cells at 1-5Â Âµg/mL levels, depending on the cell line.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Batroxobin	Batroxobin				9039-61-6				Batroxobin is a serine protease derived from the venom of Bothrops atrox. Its molecular weight is approximately 43,000 g/mol. This thrombin-like proteolytic enzyme splits the 16 Arg-17 Gly bond in the A(alpha)-chain of fibrinogen, releasing fibrinopeptide A and leading to the clot formation through aggregation of formed of fibrin I monomer or Des-AA-monomer. In contrast to other anti-coagulants, it does not affect the functions of platelets. Hence, Batroxobin is used to determine fibrinogen in plasma, to measure a 'batroxobin clotting time' as a heparin-insensitive parallel to the thrombin time, to investigate dysfibrinogenemia, and to test the contractile system of platelets

http://dbpedia.org/resource/TROX-1	TROX-1	25256198							TROX-1 is a drug which acts as a potent blocker of the Cav2 type calcium channels. It was developed as a potential analgesic after the discovery that the selective Cav2.2 blocker ziconotide is an active analgesic with similar efficacy to strong opioid drugs but comparatively milder side effects. Unlike ziconotide, TROX-1 is not so selective, and also blocks the Cav2.1 and Cav2.3 calcium channel subtypes, but it has the great advantage of being orally active, whereas ziconotide must be administered intrathecally, by injection into the spinal fluid. In animal studies of TROX-1, analgesic effects were observed with similar efficacy to NSAIDs such as naproxen or diclofenac, and anti-allodynia effects equivalent to pregabalin or duloxetine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bupropion/naltrexone	Bupropion/naltrexone								Bupropion/naltrexone (proposed trade name Contrave) is an experimental treatment for obesity in phase III clinical trials. Currently being developed by Orexigen in a sustained-release formulation, it is a combination of two approved drugs, bupropion and naltrexone. Both drugs have individually shown some evidence of effectiveness in weight loss, and the combination is expected to have a synergistic effect. In clinical trials, patients taking Contrave combined with diet and exercise lost more weight than patients taking a placebo and following the same diet and exercise program. On 31 March 2010, Orexigen submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this drug combination. On 7 December 2010, an FDA Advisory Committee voted 13-7 for the approval of Contrave, and voted 11-8 for the conduct of a post-marketing cardiovascular outcomes study. Contrave's PDUFA date is 31 January 2011. Subsequently, on 2 February 2011, the FDA rejected the drug and it was decided that an extremely large-scale study of the long-term cardiovascular effects of Contrave would be needed, before approval could be considered. The recommended daily dose of Contrave is two (8Â mg naltrexone/90Â mg bupropion) tablets taken twice daily (4 tablets total - 32Â mg naltrexone, 360Â mg bupropion). Upon initiation, the drug will be started with a quarter-dose (or one tablet) for one week and a pill will be added to the regimen each week until the full recommended dose is reached on Week 4. During phase 2 testing, different dosages were used in a once daily formula. These include: 16Â mg naltrexone - 400Â mg bupropion 32Â mg naltrexone - 400Â mg bupropion 48Â mg naltrexone - 400Â mg bupropion The second dosage (32Â mg-400Â mg) on average showed the best benefit-to-risk ratio. Treatment is designed to influence the hypothalamus in order to decrease food intake over an extended period of time. Studies of almost 700 patients, 90% female, ran up to 56 weeks. The control group, overall, lost 5% of their initial body weight, or 11-16Â lbs. The experimental (medicated) group lost 20-23Â lbs during the same amount of time. The average starting weight for participants was 223Â lbs. Current medical weight loss medications average 5-22Â lbs lost in 6 months.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cytarabine	Cytarabine	6253	DB00987	04079A1RDZ	147-94-4		Injectable	Liver	Cytarabine or cytosine arabinoside (Cytosar-U or Depocyt) is a chemotherapy agent used mainly in the treatment of cancers of white blood cells such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is also known as Ara-C (Arabinofuranosyl Cytidine). It kills cancer cells by interfering with DNA synthesis. It is called cytosine arabinoside because it combines a cytosine base with an arabinose sugar. Cytosine normally combines with a different sugar, deoxyribose, to form deoxycytidine, a component of DNA. Certain sponges, where it was originally found, use arabinoside sugars to form a different compound (not part of DNA). Cytosine arabinoside is similar enough to human cytosine deoxyribose (deoxycytidine) to be incorporated into human DNA, but different enough that it kills the cell. This mechanism is used to kill cancer cells. Cytarabine is the first of a series of cancer drugs that altered the sugar component of nucleosides. Other cancer drugs modify the base.

During development it was known as FE200486. Testosterone is a male hormone that promotes growth of many prostate tumours and therefore reducing circulating testosterone to very low levels is often the treatment goal in the management of men with advanced prostate cancer. Degarelix has an immediate onset of action, binding to gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptors in the pituitary gland and blocking their interaction with GnRH. This induces a fast and profound reduction in luteinising hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and in turn, testosterone suppression.

On February 22, 2005, the US FDA approved a sustained release form of doxazosin, to be marketed as Cardura XL. It is an alpha-1 adrenergic receptor blocker that inhibits the binding of norepinephrine (released from sympathetic nerve terminals) to the alpha-1 receptors on the membrane of vascular smooth muscle cells. The primary effect of this inhibition is relaxed vascular smooth muscle tone, which decreases peripheral vascular resistance, leading to decreased blood pressure. Doxazosin and similar medications like prazosin have been found to help reduce the intensity of and/or stop posttraumatic stress disorder night terrors and nightmares. The full reasoning of this effect is not understood.

It acts by decreasing cholesterol absorption in the intestine. It may be used alone (marketed as Zetia or Ezetrol), when other cholesterol-lowering medications are not tolerated, or together with statins when statins alone do not control cholesterol. Ezetimibe decreases cholesterol levels, but has not been shown to improve outcomes in cardiovascular disease patients by decreasing atherosclerotic or vascular events compared to placebo. Ezetimibe is endorsed in the Canadian Lipid Guidelines and is considered a well-tolerated option for an add-on agent to statin, to help patients achieve their LDL (or bad cholesterol) targets. Ezetimibe is the only add-on to statin therapy that has successfully shown cardiovascular benefit when combined with statin, but has not been proven to have an incremental benefit compared to statins alone. Britain's NICE statement, published in 2007, endorses its use for monotherapy if statins are not tolerated or as add-on therapy.

It is classified as a second generation sulfonylurea, which means that it undergoes enterohepatic circulation. Second-generation sulfonylureas are both more potent and have shorter half-lives than the first-generation sulfonylureas. Mechanism of action is produced by blocking potassium channels in the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans. By partially blocking the potassium channels, the cell remains depolarized, increasing the time the cell spends in the calcium release stage of cell, which results in signaling leading to calcium influx. The increase in calcium will initiate more insulin release from each beta cell. Sulfonylureas may also cause the decrease of serum glucagon and potentiate the action of insulin at the extrapancreatic tissues. Originally available in 1984, it is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Glucotrol in the USA, where Pfizer sells Glucotrol in doses of 5 and 10 milligrams and Glucotrol XL (an extended release form of glipizide) in doses of 2.5, 5, and 10 milligrams.

It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in Belgium, in 1966, where it was prepared initially in the form of its racemate (called tetramisole). The two stereoisomers of tetramisole were subsequently synthesized, and the levorotatory isomer was given the name levamisole. Levamisole has been used in humans to treat parasitic worm infections, and has been studied in combination with other forms of chemotherapy for colon cancer, melanoma, and head and neck cancer. In some of the leukemic cell line studies, both levamisole and tetramisole showed similar effect. The drug was withdrawn from the US and Canadian markets in 2000 and 2003, respectively, due to the risk of serious side effects and the availability of more effective replacement medications. The key toxic effect of the drug is agranulocytosis, a severe depletion of white blood cells that leaves patients vulnerable to infection.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miglustat	Miglustat	51634	DB00419	ADN3S497AZ	72599-27-0		Oral	Nil	Miglustat is a drug developed by Actelion and is used primarily to treat Type 1 Gaucher disease (GD1). It is marketed under the trade name Zavesca. Miglustat (OGT 918, N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin) is an imino sugar, a synthetic analogue of D-glucose and a white to off-white crystalline solid that has a bitter taste The primary pharmacological activity of miglustat is inhibition of the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, catalyzing the first step in the biosynthesis of glycosphingolipids (GSL), i.e. , the formation of glucosylceramide (GlcCer). Reduced formation of GlcCer will lead to decreased biosynthesis of more complex GSL. This therapeutic principle, called substrate reduction therapy (SRT), may be useful in disorders of intracellular (predominantly lysosomal) accumulation of GSL either due to their deficient breakdown or intracellular transport/trafficking. Miglustat exhibits a large volume of distribution and has the capacity to access deep organs such as the brain, bone and lung. Miglustat inhibits glucosylceramide synthase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids (it forms glucosylceramide and accumulates within the macrophages). Miglustat is used to treat adults with mild to moderate type 1 Gaucher disease and it is the first treatment to be approved for patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease. Miglustat may only be used in the treatment of type 1 Gaucher patients for whom enzyme replacement therapy is unsuitable and it's been approved in the European Union for the treatment of progressive neurological manifestations in adult or pediatric patients with Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC). It has also been approved for NPC treatment in Canada, Switzerland, Brazil, Australia, Turkey and Israel but not in the United States. Type 1 Gaucher disease is an autosomal recessive disorder one gets from both parents. People with type 1 Gaucher have a defect in the enzyme called glucocerebrosidase (also known as acid Î²-glucosidase) that acts on a fatty substance glucosylceramide (also known as glucocerebroside). Accumulation of glucosylceramide causes liver and spleen enlargement, changes in the bone marrow and blood, and bone disease. Treatment with miglustat is known as substrate reduction therapy (SRT). Unlike enzyme replacement therapy (ERT), which has a direct effect on the breakdown of glycosphingolipids, the concept of SRT in Gaucher disease involves reduction of the delivery of potential storage material to the macrophage system. Patients treated with miglustat for 3 years show signicant improvements in organ volumes and haematological parameters. Miglustat was effective over time and showed acceptable tolerability in patients who continued with treatment for 3 years. It is also being investigated to treat Tay-sachs disease, particularly late-onset Tay-Sachs. In October 2007, Actelion initiated a Phase IIa proof-of-concept clinical trial with Miglustat in cystic fibrosis (CF). It is the first time that Miglustat is being tested in a clinical setting involving 25 CF patients affected by the specific delF508 mutation.

Oxprenolol is a lipophilic beta blocker which passes the bloodâ€“brain barrier more easily than water soluble beta blockers. As such, it is associated with a higher incidence of CNS-related side effects than hydrophilic ligands such as atenolol, sotalol and nadolol. Oxprenolol is a potent beta blocker and should not be administered to asthmatics under any circumstances due to their low beta levels as a result of depletion due to other asthma medication, and because it can cause irreversible, often fatal, airway failure and inflammation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxymorphone	Oxymorphone	5284604	DB01192	9VXA968E0C	76-41-5		intravenous, intramusucular, subcutaneous, oral, rectal, intranasal.	hepatic	"Oxymorphone (Opana, Numorphan, Numorphone) or 14-Hydroxydihydromorphinone is a powerful semi-synthetic opioid analgesic first developed in Germany in 1914, patented in the USA by Endo Pharmaceuticals in 1955 and introduced to the United States market in January 1959 and other countries around the same time. It (along with hydromorphone) was designed to have less incidence of side effects than morphine and heroin. The brand name Numorphan is derived by analogy to the Nucodan name for an oxycodone product (or vice versa) as well as Paramorphan/Paramorfan for dihydromorphine and Paracodin. The only commercially available salt of oxymorphone in most of the world at this time is the hydrochloride, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.891. In some countries, hydromorphinol is distributed under the trade names Numorphan and Numorphan Oral. This is a relatively rare exception and the two drugs, whilst both being strong opioid analgesics, are notably different from one another. Oxymorphone is administered as its hydrochloride salt via injection, or suppository; typically in dosages of 1Â mg (injected) to 5Â mg (suppository). Endo has been the major distributor of oxymorphone throughout the world and currently markets oxymorphone in the United States and elsewhere as Opana and Opana ER. Opana is available as 5Â mg and 10Â mg tablets; Opana ER, an extended-release form of oxymorphone, is available as tablets in strengths of 5Â mg,10Â mg, 20Â mg, 30Â mg, and 40Â mg. As of July 21, 2011 generic strengths equivalent to Opana ER 7Â½Â mg and 15Â mg are available. Some resources assert that 2, 12 and/or 15Â mg IR tablets and 25, 36 and 50Â mg extended release tablets will be introduced although apparently the timeline on that is not known to the public at this time. Opana Extended-Release tablets are based on the TIMERx system developed by a consortium led by Endo and Penwest. Some of these strengths (notably not the 7.5Â mg) are available in an Opana IRâ€“immediate releaseâ€“form for breakthrough pain to be used by patients already on 24/7 opioid care such as fentanyl patches and sustained-relief morphine drugs like Avinza. In addition to the sustained-release version for Opana, other versions of TIMERx are available and being developed for other protocols such as increasing, decreasing, stepwise increasing, and stepwise decreasing dose delivery over time, single and multiple bursts of medication, and combinations of the above. Opana ER was changed to the INTAC platform of extended release and abuse deterent as of 2012. Similar to the changed Oxycontin platform, both developed by Grunenthal using Polyethylenoxide under pressure and heat for extruding pills. Specifically, the apparent extension of the duration of effect of the IR tablets (all other things being equal, oxymorphone has a duration of action of 5 to 8 hours in most patients) versus similar drugs in commonly used immediate-release formsâ€”for example Dilaudid, morphine, Vilan, Paramorfan as well as prodrugs for this group such as hydrocodone, nicocodeine, codeine, dihydrocodeine and othersâ€”is often attributed to a marginal extended-release effect from various excipients, particularly those that are hydrophilic and form a gel-like substance at the pH levels in the stomach and duodenum. Both as the result of this and the pharmacokinetics of oxymorphone, the IR tablets have a de facto duration of action of 5 to 13 hours (the mean would seem to be around 7 hours with a moderately small standard deviation and a left-skewed and leptokurtic frequency distribution) in patients with normal kidney and liver function. As a result, patients rotated on to extended release oxymorphone preparations from other opioids may very well need the Opana IR tablets, Numorphan ampoules or phials with hypodermic needles and/or a PCA pump, or immediate-release formulations of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, high dose oxycodone, hydromorphinol, nicomorphine, diamorphine, or morphine for breakthrough pain incidents already in progress. An oxymorphone nasal spray is reportedly in development, along with a possible hydromorphone nasal spray and implantable osmotic pumps for both drugs. The duration of action and metabolic half-life of oxymorphone mean that immediate-release tablets are more similar to analgesic preparations of methadone, levorphanol, piritramide, and existing extended-release forms of morphine, oxycodone, ketobemidone and so on. The extended-release Opana tablets can provide detectable analgesia for anywhere from 6 to 36+ hours (the mean appears to be very close to the lower end of the continuum), largely contingent on things that can alter the drug's liberation, absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination profile. One cause is unusual conditions in the upper and middle GI tract, such as created by misoprostol and Arthrotec. Among other things, misoprostol is a smooth muscle agent with both a contact and systemic mucousagogue that coats the stomach and adjacent areas with increasing amounts of mucus. This can result in everything from even slower onset of action to intact tablets being passed with stool. Oxymorphone is also produced within the human body when the liver metabolises oxycodone by means of O demethylation catalysed by the CYP2D6 enzyme. Approximately 10% of the dose is processed by the endocrine system in this respect; this can vary widely from person to person. The codeine-hydrocodone group and morphinans exhibit the same characteristics. Consuming alcohol with Opana extended-release tablets can be an extremely dangerous situation. The absorption of oxymorphone can vary wildly in the presence of alcohol. Plasma concentrations were found to be as low as -50% of expected to as much as 270% more than expected. Elevated plasma levels could result in overdose. Opana ER does not cause ""dose dumping"", which creates a blast of drug release that plagues other long acting opioids."

It is marketed as Dynastat in the European Union. Parecoxib is a COX2 selective inhibitor in the same category as celecoxib and rofecoxib. As it is injectable, it can be used perioperatively when patients are unable to take oral medications. It is approved through much of Europe for short term perioperative pain control much in the same way ketorolac is used in the United States. However, unlike ketorolac, parecoxib has no effect on platelet function and therefore does not promote bleeding during or after surgery. In addition, ketorolac has a much higher gastrointestinal toxicity profile compared to most other nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs including ibuprofen and naprosyn. However, in the United States ketorolac is the only injectable NSAID, although it is banned in many European countries due to concerns about surgical bleeding and stomach ulcers after surgery. In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a letter of non-approval for parecoxib in the United States. No reasons were ever documented publicly for the non-approval, although one study noted increased occurrences of heart attacks following cardiac bypass surgery compared to placebo when high doses of parecoxib were used to control pain after surgery. It is also important to remember that rare but severe allergic reactions (Stevens-Johnson Syndrome, Lyell Syndrome) have been described with valdecoxib, the molecule to which parecoxib is converted. The drug is not approved for use after cardiac surgery in Europe. Ketorolac, still banned in much of Europe, is therefore the only option in the United States, and it is not clear whether parecoxib will be resubmitted to the FDA in the future. All antiiflammatory medications in the U.S. carry the same warning regarding skin reactions, and none are approved for use during CABG surgery, so the reason for the FDA denying the approval of parecoxib remains unknown, but was likely related to political pressure from the US Congress to not approve another COX-2 selective inhibitor in the wake of the Vioxx affair. No COX-2 selective inhibitor has been approved in the US since that time, regardless of the safety profile of parecoxib in Europe.

Ketorolac, still banned in much of Europe, is therefore the only option in the United States, and it is not clear whether parecoxib will be resubmitted to the FDA in the future. All antiiflammatory medications in the U.S. carry the same warning regarding skin reactions, and none are approved for use during CABG surgery, so the reason for the FDA denying the approval of parecoxib remains unknown, but was likely related to political pressure from the US Congress to not approve another COX-2 selective inhibitor in the wake of the Vioxx affair. No COX-2 selective inhibitor has been approved in the US since that time, regardless of the safety profile of parecoxib in Europe.

Pethidine was the first synthetic opioid synthesized in 1932 as a potential anti-spasmodic agent by the chemist Otto Eislib. Its analgesic properties were first recognized by Otto Schaumann working for IG Farben, Germany. Pethidine is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe pain, and is delivered as a hydrochloride salt in tablets, as a syrup, or by intramuscular, subcutaneous or intravenous injection. For much of the 20th century, pethidine was the opioid of choice for many physicians; in 1975 60% of doctors prescribed it for acute pain and 22% for chronic severe pain. Compared to morphine, pethidine was supposed to be safer and carry less risk of addiction, and to be superior in treating the pain associated with biliary spasm or renal colic due to its putative antispasmodic effects. In fact, pethidine is no more effective than morphine at treating biliary or renal pain, and its low potency, short duration of action, and unique toxicity relative to other available opioid analgesics have seen it fall out of favor in recent years for all but a very few, very specific indications. Several countries, including Australia, have put strict limits on its use. Nevertheless, some physicians continue to use it as a first line strong opioid.

Its chemical name is 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine (2CDA). As a purine analog, it is a synthetic anti-cancer agent that also suppresses the immune system. Chemically, it mimics the nucleoside adenosine and thus inhibits the enzyme adenosine deaminase, which interferes with the cell's ability to process DNA. It is easily destroyed by normal cells except for blood cells, with the result that it produces relatively few side effects and results in very little non-target cell loss.

Cloxacillin was discovered and developed by Beecham. It is sold under a number of trade names, including Cloxapen, Cloxacap, Tegopen and Orbenin. Cloxacillin is used against staphylococci that produce beta-lactamase, due to its large R chain, which does not allow the beta-lactamases to bind. This drug has a weaker antibacterial activity than benzylpenicillin, and is devoid of serious toxicity except for allergic reactions. It has been suggested, in one study, that increased use of cloxacillin may permit reduced use of vancomycin.

It was approved in 2004 for hyponatremia (low blood sodium levels) caused by syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone (SIADH), and there is some evidence it may be effective in heart failure. It is marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. Conivaptan inhibits two of the three subtypes of the vasopressin receptor. Effectively, it causes iatrogenic nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Conivaptan has not been approved by the FDA for the treatment of decompensated congestive heart failure. However, in theory, vasopressin receptor antagonism would be particularly useful in this setting, and an initial study shows that it has some promise.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diphenoxylate	Diphenoxylate	13505	DB01081	73312P173G	915-30-0		Oral		Diphenoxylate (R-1132) is an opioid agonist used for the treatment of diarrhea that acts by slowing intestinal contractions and peristalsis allowing the body to consolidate intestinal contents and prolong transit time, thus allowing the intestines to draw moisture out of them at a normal or higher rate and therefore stop the formation of loose and liquid stools. It is the main active ingredient in the anti-peristaltic medication Lomotil, which also contains atropine as noted below. Diphenoxylate is the prototype of a small subfamily of opioids including difenoxin (diphenoxylic acid) (an active metabolite of diphenoxylate produced in the human body) and loperamide (which unlike the other two work exclusively in the intestines because it does not cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier). It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1956. It is a congener to the narcotic pethidine of which the common brand names are Dolantin and Demerol amongst others. Other somewhat more distant relatives include alphaprodine (Nisentil) and piritramide (Dipidolor).

It is a member of the class of drugs known as aromatase inhibitors. Some breast cancers require estrogen to grow. Those cancers have estrogen receptors (ERs), and are called ER-positive. They may also be called estrogen-responsive, hormonally-responsive, or hormone-receptor-positive. Aromatase is an enzyme that synthesizes estrogen. Aromatase inhibitors block the synthesis of estrogen. This lowers the estrogen level, and slows the growth of cancers.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Furazabol	Furazabol	14708	DB01514	2W07HSP5PX	1239-29-8		Oral		"Furazabol (Miotolan) is a derivative of the anabolic steroid stanozolol. It differs from stanozolol by having a furazan ring system in place of the pyrazole. It has a c-17alpha methyl group, which allows it to be taken orally and causes hepatotoxicity in some individuals. According to William Llewellyn, author of Anabolics 2007, the cholesterol-lowering effects of furazabol are a myth. In the 1970s, research studies showed that furazabol along with many other orally-active AAS like Anavar (oxandrolone) lowered total serum cholesterol. It was subsequently established that the cholesterol reduction from oral AAS was the result of suppressed HDL levels. As such, it would be expected that furazabol, like other oral anabolic steroids, while reducing total cholesterol levels would still adversely affect the HDL/LDL ratio and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. The Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for stanozolol after winning the gold medal in the 100 meter sprint at the 1988 Summer Olympics. His doctor, Dr. Jamie Astaphan, maintains that his urine sample was sabotaged because Johnson was administered furazabol, which was not an IOC banned substance at the time. Subsequently, training partner and fellow Charlie Francis athlete Angela Issajenko (Taylor), in her book ""Running Risks"" outlined a theory stating Ben Johnson actually was using stanozolol. She substantiated this by stating that her supply of what she thought was furazabol was retested following the Dubin Inquiry and was found to be stanozolol, explaining the positive test."

Structurally, it is a decapeptide. Goserelin acetate is used to suppress production of the sex hormones, particularly in the treatment of breast and prostate cancer. Goserelin acetate stimulates the production of the sex hormones testosterone and estrogen in a non-pulsatile (non-physiological) manner. This causes the disruption of the endogenous hormonal feedback systems, resulting in the down-regulation of testosterone and estrogen production. Zoladex was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1989 for treatment of prostate cancer.

The original brand, Floxin, has been discontinued by the manufacturer in the United States on 18 June 2009, though generic equivalents continue to be available. Ofloxacin was first patented in 1982 (European Patent Daiichi) and received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on December 28, 1990. Ofloxacin is sold under a wide variety of brand names as well as generic drug equivalents, for oral and intravenous administration. Ofloxacin is also available for topical use, as eye drops and ear drops (marketed as Ocuflox and Floxin Otic respectively in the United States). Ofloxacin is a racemic mixture, which consists of 50% levofloxacin (the biologically active component) and 50% of its â€œmirror imageâ€ﾝ or enantiomer dextrofloxacin. When levofloxacin disks were not available in early clinical trials, a 5-pg ofloxacin disk was substituted. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) medical reviewers considered the two drugs to be one and the same and hence interchangeable. Like other quinolones, ofloxacin has been associated with a significant number of serious adverse drug reactions, such as tendon damage (including spontaneous tendon ruptures) and peripheral neuropathy (which may be irreversible); such reactions may manifest long after therapy had been completed, and, in severe cases, may result in lifelong disabilities. Ofloxacin has also been associated with severe psychiatric adverse reactions. Hepatotoxicity has also been reported with the use of ofloxacin. Case reports of hepatitis have been published for the older fluoroquinolones including ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and norfloxacin.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diprenorphine	Diprenorphine	443408	DB01548	1F0L5N25ZZ	14357-78-9				Diprenorphine (diprenorfin, Revivon, M5050) is an opioid antagonist used to reverse the effects of the super-potent opioid analgesics such as etorphine and carfentanil that are used for tranquilizing large animals in veterinary medicine. Diprenorphine is the strongest opiate antagonist that is commercially available (some 100 times more potent as an antagonist than nalorphine), and is used for reversing the effects of very strong opioids for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not effectively or reliably reverse the narcotic effects. These super-potent opioids, with the single exception of buprenorphine, are not used in humans because the dose for a human is so small that it would be difficult to measure properly, so there is an excessive risk of overdose leading to fatal respiratory depression. However conventional opioid derivatives are not strong enough to rapidly tranquilize large animals such as elephants and rhinos, so drugs such as etorphine or carfentanil are available for this purpose. Diprenorphine is considered the specific antagonist for etorphine and carfentanil, and is normally used to remobilise animals once veterinary procedures have been completed,. Because diprenorphine also has some agonistic properties of its own, it should not be used on humans in the event that they are accidentally exposed to etorphine or carfentanil. Naloxone or naltrexone are the preferred human antagonists. In theory, diprenorphine could also be used as an antidote for treating overdose of certain opioid derivatives which are used in humans, such as buprenorphine, for which the binding affinity is so high that naloxone does not reliably reverse the narcotic effects. However, diprenorphine is not generally available in hospitals; instead a vial of diprenorphine is supplied with etorphine or carfentanil specifically for reversing the effects of these drugs, so use of diprenorphine for treating e.g. a buprenorphine overdose is not carried out in practice, although it would work in theory.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethylmorphine	Ethylmorphine	5359271	DB01466	RWO67D87EU	76-58-4				Ethylmorphine (also known as codethyline, dionine, and ethyl morphine) is an opiate narcotic analgesic (pain killer). Ethylmorphine was invented in Germany at Merck in 1884 and was used as a weaker alternative to heroin for all indications. Chemically, ethylmorphine is a morphine molecule with a -OC2H5 group substituted for the aromatic 3-OH group. Therefore the closest chemical relative of ethylmorphine is codeine, also known as methylmorphine. Ethylmorphine also has a hydromorphone analogue (ethyldihydromorphinone or 3-ethoxy-7,8-dihydro-morphin-6-one), and a dihydromorphine analogue known as ethyldihydromorphine, although none of them appears to be commercially distributed at the current time. As is the case with all narcotic analgesics, ethylmorphine is potentially habit-forming and can generate drug dependence of the codeine type. In most countries and internationally ethylmorphine and codeine are regulated much the same way. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and similar weak opioid drugs, ethylmorphine is listed under the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs in Schedule III, which leads to some ethylmorphine preparations being available over the counter in some countries. In the US, ethylmorphine, like its methyl analog codeine, is controlled under the Controlled Substances Act, Schedule II as a pure compound and Schedule III when combined with non-opioid analgesics such as paracetamol (akin to US Schedule III paracetamol/codeine combinations sold under the brand name Tylenol 3/4). In theory, cough syrup containing ethylmorphine is listed in US Schedule V, meaning that it can be bought without prescription in certain states if the patient presents ID and/or the chemist knows the person and the patient signs a dispensary log that is monitored by the DEA. However, there are currently no ethylmorphine-based pharmaceuticals marketed in the US, making this a moot point; codeine-based products, on the other hand, are still relatively common.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Insulin_detemir	Insulin detemir		DB01307	4FT78T86XV	169148-63-4		Subcutaneous		"Insulin detemir is a long-acting human insulin analogue for maintaining the basal level of insulin. Novo Nordisk markets it under the trade name Levemir. It is an insulin analogue in which a fatty acid is bound to the lysine amino acid at position B29. It is quickly absorbed after which it binds to albumin in the blood through its fatty acid at position B29. It then slowly dissociates from this complex. In a clinical study that compared the efficacy and safety of using Levemir for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes who had suboptimal glycemic control while receiving maximally tolerated doses of metformin and sulfonylurea (common tablet therapies for type 2 diabetes), it was found that, ""At 24 weeks, A1C had decreased by 1.8 and 1.9% (from 8.6 to 6.8 and from 8.5 to 6.6%) for detemir and NPH, respectively (NS). In both groups, 70% of participants achieved an A1C of 7.0%, but the proportion achieving this without hypoglycemia was higher with insulin detemir than with NPH insulin (26 vs. 16%, P = 0.008). Compared with NPH insulin, the risk for all hypoglycemia with insulin detemir was reduced by 47% (P < 0.001) and nocturnal hypoglycemia by 55% (P < 0.001). Mean weight gain was 1.2Â kg with insulin detemir and 2.8Â kg with NPH insulin (P < 0.001), and the difference in baseline-adjusted final weight was â€“1.58 (P < 0.001). "" In short, it was found that insulin detemir reduced Hemoglobin A1C to target levels of 7.0% for 70% of patients, similar to human basal insulin NPH, but without the same risk of hypoglycemia and with somewhat less weight gain. Regarding weight gain compared to NPH insulin, the The Levemir package insert states the following disclaimer: ""LEVEMIR was associated with somewhat less weight gain than NPH (Table 4). Whether these observed differences represent true differences in the effects of LEVEMIR and NPH insulin is not known, since these trials were not blinded and the protocols (e.g. , diet and exercise instructions and monitoring) were not specifically directed at exploring hypotheses related to weight effects of the treatments compared.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dapagliflozin	Dapagliflozin	9887712		1ULL0QJ8UC	461432-26-8		Oral		Dapagliflozin is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes. It was developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb in partnership with AstraZeneca. Although dapagliflozin's method of action would operate on both types of diabetes and other conditions resulting in hyperglycemia, the current clinical trials specifically exclude participants with type 1 diabetes. In July 2011 an US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) committee recommended against approval until more data was available. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) date for dapagliflozin for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes was extended three months by the FDA to January 28, 2012. In April 2012, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion on the drug. It is now marketed in a number of European countries including the UK and Germany.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dapoxetine	Dapoxetine	71353		GB2433A4M3	119356-77-3		Oral		Dapoxetine, marketed as Priligy, Kutub, or Duratia, is the first compound developed specially for the treatment of premature ejaculation (PE) in men 18â€“64 years old. Dapoxetine works by inhibiting the serotonin transporter, increasing serotoninâ€™s action at the post synaptic cleft, and as a consequence promoting ejaculatory delay. As a member of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) family, dapoxetine was initially created as an antidepressant. However, unlike other SSRIs, dapoxetine is absorbed and eliminated rapidly in the body. Its fast acting property makes it suitable for the treatment of PE but not as an antidepressant. Originally created by Eli Lilly pharmaceutical company, dapoxetine was sold to Johnson & Johnson in 2003 and submitted as a new drug application to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of PE in 2004. Dapoxetine has been sold in several European and Asian countries, and lately in Mexico. In the US, dapoxetine is in phase III development and expected to be marketed soon.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ketanserin	Ketanserin	3822		97F9DE4CT4	74050-98-9				Ketanserin (R41468) is a drug with affinity for multiple G protein-coupled receptors. Initially it was believed to be a highly selective antagonist for serotonin 5-HT2A receptors, however this is not true. Ketanserin only has moderate selectivity for 5-HT2A receptors over 5-HT2C receptors (~20-30 fold). Ketanserin also has high affinity for alpha-1 adrenergic receptors, and very high affinity for histamine H1 receptors. Therefore, ketanserin can not be used to reliably discriminate between the effects of 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors when both are present in an experimental system. Furthermore, when alpha-1 and H1 receptors are present, the effects of ketanserin can potentially represent a complex interaction of serotonin, adrenergic, and histamine receptor systems. Complicating the matter further is the fact that ketanserin has moderate affinity for delta-1t adrenergic receptor (~200 nM) and 5-HT6 (~300 nM) receptors as well as weak affinity for dopamine D1 and D2 receptors (~300 nM and ~500 nM respectively). Ketanserin at levels of 500 nM or greater are thus potentially affecting at least 8 different GPCRs from 4 different families. (All affinity levels taken from the NIMH Psychoactive Drug Screening Program database) Receptors for which ketanserin has high affinity binding: 5-HT2A = 2-3 nM (rat and human) 5-HT2C = 50 nM (rat), 100 nM (human) alpha-1 adrenergic = ~40 nM Histamine H1 = 2 nM Solubility: 6 mg/mL 0.1 M HCl 10 mM H20 3.3 mg/mL ethanol 52 mg/mL DMSO Ketanserin was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1980.

It currently has no clinical applications in humans, although it was originally researched as an antidepressant. Nisoxetine is now widely used in scientific research as a standard selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It has been used to research obesity and energy balance, and exerts some local analgesia effects. Researchers have attempted to use a carbon-labeled form of nisoxetine for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging of the norepinephrine transporter (NET), with little success. However, it seems that tritium labeled nisoxetine (H-nisoxetine, H-NIS) is a useful radioligand for labeling norepinephrine uptake sites in vitro, which nisoxetine and other antagonists for NET are able to inhibit.

Pancreatin is sometimes called ""pancreatic acid"", although it is neither a single chemical substance nor an acid. Pancreatin contains the pancreatic enzymes trypsin, amylase and lipase. A similar mixture of enzymes is sold as pancrelipase, which contains more active lipase enzyme than does pancreatin. The trypsin found in pancreatin works to hydrolyze proteins into oligopeptides; amylase hydrolyzes starches into oligosaccharides and the disaccharide maltose; and lipase hydrolyzes triglycerides into fatty acids and glycerols. Pancreatin is an effective enzyme supplement for replacing missing pancreatic enzymes, and aids in the digestion of foods in cases of pancreatic insufficiency. Pancreatin reduces the absorption of iron from food in the duodenum during digestion Some contact lens cleaning solutions contain porcine pancreatin extractives to assist in the intended protein-removal process."

Structurally, it differs from testosterone only in the configuration at the OH-bearing carbon, . Epitestosterone is believed to form in a similar way to testosterone; a 1993 study found that around 50% of epitestosterone production in human males can be ascribed to the testis, although the exact pathway of its formation is still the subject of research. It has been shown to accumulate in mammary cyst fluid and in the prostate. Epitestosterone levels are typically highest in young males; however, by adulthood, most healthy males exhibit a testosterone to epitestosterone ratio (T/E ratio) of about 1:1.

It was initially developed in the late-1970s and used in scientific research before being sold as a designer drug in the mid-2000s. It has been detected in pills touted as legal alternatives to illicit stimulants in New Zealand and pills sold as ""ecstasy"" in Europe and the United States. Despite its advertisement as a recreational substance, mCPP is actually generally considered to be an unpleasant experience and is not desired by drug users. It lacks any reinforcing effects, produces depressive and anxiogenic effects in rodents and humans, and can induce panic attacks in individuals susceptible to them. It also worsens obsessive-compulsive symptoms in people with the disorder. mCPP is known to induce headaches in humans and has been used for testing potential antimigraine medications. It has potent anorectic effects and has encouraged the development of selective 5-HT2C receptor agonists for the treatment of obesity as well. Meta-chlorophenylpiperazine is a major metabolite of the psychotropic drug trazodone, and may be responsible for some of its side-effects, such as headaches and migraines induced many hours after initial consumption."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysophosphatidylcholine	Lysophosphatidylcholine								Lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC), also called lysolecithins, are a class of chemical compounds which are derived from phosphatidylcholines. They result from partial hydrolysis of phosphatidylcholines, which removes one of the fatty acid groups. The hydrolysis is generally the result of the enzymatic action of phospholipase A2. LPC can be used in the lab to cause demyelination of brain slices, to mimic the effects of demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis. Among other properties, they stimulate phagocytosis and can change the surface properties of erythrocytes. LPC is present as a minor phospholipid in the cell membrane (â‰¤ 3%) and in the blood plasma (8-12%). Since LPCs are quickly metabolized by lysophospholipase and LPC-acyltransferase, they last only shortly in vivo. By replacing the acyl-group within the LPC with an alkyl-group, alkyl-lysophospholipids (ALP) were synthesized. These analogues of LPC are metabolically stable, and several such as edelfosine, miltefosine and perifosine are under research and development as drugs against cancer and other diseases. Their anti-cancer abilities are special since they do not target the cell DNA but insert into the plasma membrane and cause apoptosis through influencing several signal pathways. Therefore their effects are independent of the proliferation state of the tumor cell.

It is marketed as Ventolin among other brand names. Salbutamol was the first selective Î²2-receptor agonist to be marketed â€” in 1968. It was first sold by Allen & Hanburys under the brand name Ventolin. The drug was an instant success, and has been used for the treatment of asthma ever since. Salbutamol sulfate is usually given by the inhaled route for direct effect on bronchial smooth muscle. This is usually achieved through a metered dose inhaler (MDI), nebulizer or other proprietary delivery devices (e.g. Rotahaler or Autohaler). In these forms of delivery, the maximal effect of salbutamol can take place within five to 20 minutes of dosing, though some relief is immediately seen. It can also be given intravenously.

In normal clinical doses it is a selective irreversible MAO-B inhibitor. However, in larger doses it loses its specificity and also inhibits MAO-A. Dietary restrictions are common for MAOI treatments, but special dietary restrictions for lower doses have been found to be unnecessary, and dietary restrictions appear to be unnecessary at standard doses when selegiline is taken as Emsam, the transdermal patch form, as no adverse events due to diet have ever been reported with Emsam. The drug was discovered by Jozsef Knoll et al. in Hungary. Selegiline belongs to a class of drugs called phenethylamines. Selegiline is a levomethamphetamine derivative with a propargyl group attached to the nitrogen atom.

In other tissues such as the endometrium, it behaves as an agonist, and thus may be characterized as a mixed agonist/antagonist. Tamoxifen is the usual endocrine therapy for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer in pre-menopausal women, and is also a standard in post-menopausal women although aromatase inhibitors are also frequently used in that setting. Some breast cancer cells require estrogen to grow. Estrogen binds to and activates the estrogen receptor in these cells. Tamoxifen is metabolized into compounds that also bind to the estrogen receptor but do not activate it. Because of this competitive antagonism, tamoxifen acts like a key broken off in the lock that prevents any other key from being inserted, preventing estrogen from binding to its receptor. Hence breast cancer cell growth is blocked. Tamoxifen was discovered by pharmaceutical company Imperial Chemical Industries and is sold under the trade names Nolvadex, Istubal, and Valodex. However, the drug, even before its patent expiration, was and still is widely referred to by its generic name ""tamoxifen."""

It is also the first drug approved to treat both pituitary- and adrenal-dependent Cushing's in dogs. This prescription drug works by stopping the production of cortisol in the adrenal glands. In studies of the drug, the most common side effects were vomiting, lack of energy, diarrhea, and weight loss. Trilostane should not be given to a dog that: has kidney or liver disease; takes certain medications used to treat heart disease; is pregnant, nursing or intended for breeding The safety and effectiveness of trilostane were shown in several studies. Success was measured by improvements in both blood test results and physical symptoms (increased appetite and activity level, and decreased panting, thirst and urination). Only one other drug, Anipryl (veterinary brand name) selegiline, is FDA-approved to treat Cushing's disease in dogs, but only to treat uncomplicated, pituitary-dependent Cushing's. The only previous treatment for the disease was the use of Mitotane (brand name Lysodren) off-label. It has been used as a progesterone inhibitor. A number of compounding pharmacies in the US sell the product. Since the US approval of Vetoryl in December 2008, compounding pharmacies are no longer able to use a bulk drug product for compounding purposes, but must prepare the compounded drug from Vetoryl. It is a 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor.

Zimelidine (Zimeldine, Normud, Zelmid) was the first selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressant to be marketed. It is a pyridylallylamine, and is structurally different from other antidepressants. Zimelidine was developed in the late 1970s and early 1980s by Arvid Carlsson, who was then working for the Swedish company Astra AB. It was discovered following a search for drugs with structures similar to brompheniramine, an antihistamine with antidepressant activity. Zimelidine was first sold in 1982. Zimelidine has been banned worldwide due to serious, sometimes fatal, cases of central and/or peripheral neuropathy known as Guillain-BarrÃ© syndrome and due to a peculiar hypersensitivity reaction involving many organs including skin exanthema, flu-like symptoms, arthralgias, and sometimes eosinophilia. Additionally, zimelidine was charged to cause an increase in suicidal ideation and/or attempts among depressive patients. After its ban, it was succeeded by fluvoxamine and fluoxetine in that order, and the other SSRIs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levorphanol	Levorphanol	5359272	DB00854	27618J1N2X	77-07-6		oral, intravenous, subcutaneous, intramuscular	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Levorphanol (Levo-Dromoran) is an opioid medication used to treat severe pain. It is the levorotatory stereoisomer of the synthetic morphinan (Dromoran) and a pure opioid agonist, first described in Germany in 1948 as an orally active morphine-like analgesic. Morphinan is the parent drug and prototype of a large series of opioid and/or NMDA antagonists and opioid agonists used in medicine including nalbuphine, butorphanol, dextromethorphan, and others. Levorphanol labeled with tritium was used in the research which led to the discovery of opioid receptors in the human nervous system, including the first study published in 1971. Levorphanol has the same properties as morphine with respect to the potential for habituation, tolerance, physical dependence and withdrawal syndrome. It is 4 to 8 times as potent as morphine and has a longer half-life. Approximately 30 mg of oral morphine is roughly equianalgesic to 4 mg of oral levorphanol. The levo isomer is the source of the narcotic properties of the racemic drug Dromoran, but the dextro isomers are also useful in medicine: in addition to acting on sigma receptors, the O-methyl derivative of its dextrorotary isomer, dextromethorphan, is a common NMDA receptor antagonist and pro-drug to dextrorphan. Oral doses of levorphanol come in 2 mg and 4 mg strengths or subcutaneous injection every 6 to 8 hours. Levorphanol has affinity to Î¼, Îº, and Î´ opioid receptors, but lacks complete cross-tolerance with morphine. The duration of action is generally long compared to other comparable analgesics, and varies from 4 hours to as much as 15 hours. For this reason levorphanol is useful in palliation of chronic pain and similar conditions. Levorphanol has an oral to parenteral effectiveness ratio of 2:1, one of the most favourable of the strong narcotics. Its NMDA actions, similar to those of the phenylheptylamine open-chain narcotics such as methadone or the phenylpiperidine ketobemidone, make levorphanol useful for types of pain that other analgesics may not be as effective against; levorphanol's sigma receptor, SNRI properties make it even more useful particularly for neuropathic pain.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenoxymethylpenicillin	Phenoxymethylpenicillin	6869	DB00417	Z61I075U2W	87-08-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enteral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Phenoxymethylpenicillin, commonly known as penicillin V, is a penicillin antibiotic that is orally active. It is less active than benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) against Gram-negative bacteria. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is more acid-stable than benzylpenicillin, which allows it to be given orally. It exerts a bactericidal action against penicillin-sensitive microorganisms during the stage of active multiplication. It acts by inhibiting the biosynthesis of cell-wall peptidoglycan. It is not active against beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, which include many strains of staphylococci. Phenoxymethylpenicillin has a range of antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria that is similar to that of benzylpenicillin and a similar mode of action, but it is substantially less active than benzylpenicillin against Gram-negative bacteria. Phenoxymethylpenicillin is usually used only for the treatment of mild to moderate infections, and not for severe or deep-seated infections since absorption can be unpredictable. Except for the treatment or prevention of infection with Streptococcus pyogenes (which is uniformly sensitive to penicillin), therapy should be guided by bacteriological studies (including sensitivity tests) and by clinical response. Patients treated initially with parenteral benzylpenicillin may continue oral treatment with phenoxymethylpenicillin once a satisfactory clinical response has been obtained. For prophylaxis against rheumatic fever, phenoxymethylpenicillin given orally twice a day is used as an alternative to injections of benzathine penicillin given every two weeks.

This reduces the volume of the blood, decreasing blood return to the heart and thus cardiac output and, by other mechanisms, is believed to lower peripheral vascular resistance. Hydrochlorothiazide is a calcium-sparing diuretic, meaning it can help the body get rid of excess water while still keeping calcium.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lisuride	Lisuride	28864	DB00589	E0QN3D755O	18016-80-3		Oral, subcutaneous, transdermal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Lisuride (Dopergin, Proclacam, Revanil) is an antiparkinson agent of the iso-ergoline class, chemically related to the dopaminergic ergoline Parkinson's drugs. Lisuride is described as free base (see table on the right) and as hydrogen maleate salt. Lisuride is used to lower prolactin and, in low doses, to prevent migraine attacks. The use of lisuride as initial anti-Parkinsonian treatment has been advocated, delaying the need for levodopa until lisuride becomes insufficient for controlling the Parkinsonian disability. Preliminary trials suggest that the dermal application of lisuride may be useful in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. As lisuride is very poorly absorbed when take orally and has a short half-life, continuous transdermal administration offers significant advantages and could make the compound a far more consistent therapeutic. Lisuride is not currently available in the US, as the drug was not a commercial success in comparison with other dopamine receptor agonist anti-parkinsonian compounds. It is still used clinically in a number of countries in the EU and is still commercially available in the UK and China.

The name ""picrotoxin"" is a combination of the Greek words ""picros"" (bitter) and ""toxicon"" (poison). Found primarily in the fruit of the climbing plant Anamirta cocculus, it has a strong physiological action. It acts as a noncompetitive antagonist for the GABAA receptor chloride channels. It is therefore a channel blocker rather than a receptor antagonist. As GABA itself is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, infusion of picrotoxin has stimulant and convulsant effects. As such, picrotoxin can be used to counter barbiturate poisoning, that can occur during general anesthesia or during a large intake outside of the hospital."

It is the d-enantiomer of fenfluramine and is structurally similar to amphetamine, but lacks any psychologically stimulating effects. Dexfenfluramine was for some years in the mid-1990s approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the purposes of weight loss. However, following multiple concerns about the cardiovascular side-effects of the drug, such approval was withdrawn and it was retired from the market in 1997. After it was removed in the US, dexfenfluramine was also pulled out in other global markets. It was later superseded by sibutramine, which although initially considered a safer alternative to both dexfenfluramine and fenfluramine, was also removed from the US market in 2010. The drug was manufactured by Interneuron Pharmaceuticals, a company co-founded by Richard Wurtman, aimed at marketing discoveries by Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientists. In the case of Redux, Interneuron's manufacture was under licence to Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories. Although at the time of its release, some optimism prevailed that it might herald a new approach, there remained some reservations amongst neurologists, twenty-two of whom petitioned the FDA to delay approval. Their concern was based on the work of George A. Ricaurte, whose techniques and conclusions were later questioned.. In actuality, most conversant with the discussion felt that dexfenfuramine's only advantage was patent protection for its licensed companies. Racemic fenfluramine was far cheaper.

It was marketed by the pharmaceutical company Bayer A.G. in the late 1990s, competing with Pfizer's highly successful atorvastatin (Lipitor). Cerivastatin was voluntarily withdrawn from the market worldwide in 2001, due to reports of fatal rhabdomyolysis. During post-marketing surveillance, 52 deaths were reported in patients using cerivastatin, mainly from rhabdomyolysis and its resultant renal failure. Risks were higher in patients using fibrates, mainly gemfibrozil (Lopid), and in patients using the highest (0.8Â mg/day) dose of cerivastatin. Bayer A.G. added a contraindication for the concomitant use of cerivastatin and gemfibrozil to the package 18 months after the drug interaction was found. The frequency of deadly cases of rhabdomyolysis with cerivastatin was 16 to 80 times higher than with other statins. Another 385 nonfatal cases of rhabdomyolysis were reported. This put the risk of this (rare) complication at 5-10 times that of the other statins. Cerivastatin also induced myopathy in a dose-dependent manner when administered as monotherapy, but that was revealed only after Bayer was sued and unpublished company documents were opened.

It is also an agonist of the Ïƒ2 receptor, though the function of this orphan receptor remains controversial. Similar to levorphanolâ€”another opioid with serotoninâ€“norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) effectsâ€”in its dual mechanism of action, tapentadol provides analgesia comparable to other opioid analgesics such as hydrocodone, oxycodone, and pethidine (meperidine) but with a more tolerable side effect profile. While its analgesic actions have been compared to tramadol and oxycodone, its general potency is somewhere between tramadol and morphine in effectiveness. Tapentadol is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of moderate to severe acute pain. Due to the dual mechanism of action as an opioid agonist and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, there is also potential for off-label use in chronic pain. Physicians use SNRIs in chronic pain management to increase the effectiveness of opioids and other analgesics such as NSAIDs against neuropathic pain and from certain specific contributing causes such as fibromyalgia and diabetic neuropathy. One SNRI often used as an adjunct, atypical & potentiator is duloxetine (Cymbalta).

Under the trade-names (Stablon, Coaxil, Tatinol) it is a drug used for treating major depressive episodes (mild, moderate, or severe). It has structural similarities to the tricyclic antidepressants, but it has different pharmacological properties. Tianeptine is a selective serotonin reuptake enhancer, opposite to the action of SSRIs. One review points to the cancellative effects of tianeptine and fluoxetine coadministration on serotonin reuptake. Another suggests that long-term administration of tianeptine has no effect on serotonin pathways. Tianeptine enhances the extracellular concentration of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens and modulates the D2 and D3 dopamine receptors, but this effect is modest and almost certainly indirect. There is also action on the NMDA and AMPA receptors. Recent reviews point to this pathway as a hypothesized mechanism of action, based on tianeptine's effect of reversing impaired neuroplasticity associated with stress. Tianeptine reduces the effects of serotonin in the limbic system and the pre-frontal cortex, giving rise to a mood elevation, unlike the mood blunting associated with SSRIs. Like SSRIs, however, tianeptine's onset-of-action delay is approximately 2â€“6 weeks with improvements sometimes noticeable in as soon as one week. Its short-lived, but pleasant, stimulant effect experienced by some patients is shared with its predecessor, amineptine, whose side effects related to dopamine uptake inhibitor activity resulted in Servier's research into tianeptine. Suggested dosage is three times daily, due to its short duration of action. Tianeptine has strong antidepressant and anxiolytic properties with a relative lack of sedative, anticholinergic and cardiovascular adverse effects, thus suggesting it is particularly suitable for use in elderly patients and in those following alcohol withdrawal; such patients can be more sensitive to the adverse effects of psychotropic drugs. Recent interesting results indicate anticonvulsant and analgesic activity of tianeptine and its possible interaction with adenosine A1 receptors. Currently, Tianeptine is approved in France and manufactured and marketed by Laboratoires Servier SA; it is also marketed in a number of other European countries under the trade name ""Coaxil"" as well as in Asia and Latin America as ""Stablon"" and ""Tatinol"" but it is not available in the UK or US."

Tolvaptan was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on May 19, 2009, and is sold by Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. under the trade name Samsca and in India is manufactured & sold by MSN laboratories Ltd. under the trade name Tolvat & Tolsama. Tolvaptan is also in fast-track clinical trials for polycystic kidney disease. In a 2004 trial, tolvaptan, when administered with traditional diuretics, was noted to increase excretion of excess fluids and improve blood sodium levels in patients with heart failure without producing side effects such as hypotension (low blood pressure) or hypokalemia (decreased blood levels of potassium) and without having an adverse effect on kidney function. In a recently published trial the study met its primary and secondary end points. Tolvaptan, when given at an average dose of 95 mg per day over a 3-year period, slowed the usual increase in kidney volume by 50% compared to placebo (2.80% per year versus 5.51% per year, respectively, p<0.001) and reduced the decline in kidney function when compared with that of placebo-treated patients by approximately 30% (reciprocal serum creatinine, -2.61 versus -3.81 -1 per year, p <0.001)

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tienilic_acid	Tienilic acid	38409		HC95205SY4	40180-04-9		Oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Tienilic acid or ticrynafen is a loop diuretic drug with uric acid-lowering (uricosuric) action, formerly marketed for the treatment of hypertension. It was approved by FDA on May 2, 1979, and withdrawn in 1982, after case reports in the United States indicated a link between the use of ticrynafen and hepatitis. Criminal charges were brought against SmithKline executives with regard to hiding data related to toxicity while gaining FDA approval. The company pleaded guilty to 14 counts of failure to report adverse reactions and 20 counts of selling a misbranded drug. Tienilic acid was found to act as a suicide substrate at the cytochrome P450 enzymes involved in drug metabolism. Unfortunately, the metabolic reaction carried out by these enzymes converted tienilic acid to a thiophene sulfoxide which proved highly electrophilic. This encouraged a Michael reaction leading to alkylation of a thiol group in the enzyme's active site. Loss of water from the thiophene sulfoxide restored the thiophene ring and resulted in tienilic acid being covalently linked to the enzyme, thus inhibiting the enzyme irreversibly. The above explanation is a hypothesis. It is still not known (after 15 years) if the reactive intermediate which inactivates the CYP2C9 is the thiophene sulfoxide or the thiophene epoxide. The target on the protein is also not known (could be multiple). However tienilic acid is a good mechanism based inhibitor of CYP2C9 and seems to inactivate it stoichiometrically. Progress in proteomics may one day give the answer. Recent studies indicate that in fact the primary metabolite of tienilic acid (5-OH tienilic acid) cannot be derived from a thiophene-S-oxide intermediate as was previously hypothesized. It was determined to be derived from a thiophene epoxide intermediate and this reactive intermediate is then likely a cause for the covalent binding to as well as mechanism-based inactivation of CYP2C9.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rufinamide	Rufinamide	129228		WFW942PR79	106308-44-5		Oral		Rufinamide is an anticonvulsant medication. It is used in combination with other medication and therapy to treat Lennoxâ€“Gastaut syndrome and various other seizure disorders. Rufinamide, a triazole derivative, was developed in 2004 by Novartis Pharma, AG, and is manufactured by Eisai. Rufinamide was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration on November 14, 2008 as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome in children 4 years and older and adults. Its official FDA-approved labeling does not mention use in the treatment of partial seizures inasmuch as clinical trials submitted to the FDA were marginal. However, several recent clinical trials suggest that the drug has efficacy for partial seizures It is marketed under the brand name Banzel. It is also marketed in the European Union under the brand name Inovelon. The mechanism of action of rufinamide is unknown. However, it is presumed to involve stabilization of the sodium channel inactive state, effectively keeping these ion channels closed. Although the direct mechanism of action may be different, several other antiepileptic agents also stabilize a sodium channel inactive state including phenytoin, carbamazepine, and lacosamide (stabilizes the slow inactive state).

It is partially converted to its active metabolite desipramine in vivo. However, it is unlikely this property plays a substantial role in its overall effects as lofepramine exhibits lower toxicity and anticholinergic side effects relative to desipramine while retaining equivalent antidepressant efficacy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Racecadotril	Racecadotril	107751		76K53XP4TO	81110-73-8		Oral		Racecadotril, also known as acetorphan, is an antidiarrheal drug which acts as a peripherally acting enkephalinase inhibitor. Unlike other medications used to treat diarrhea, which reduce intestinal motility, racecadotril has an antisecretory effectâ€”it reduces the secretion of water and electrolytes into the intestine. It is available in France (where it was first introduced in 1993 and is widely used) and other European countries, as well as most of South America and some South East Asian countries, but not in the United States. It is sold under the tradenames Hidrasec or, in France, Tiorfan. In Italy it is sold under the tradename Tiorfix. A small randomized controlled trial found racecadotril to significantly reduce the duration and volume of watery diarrhea in children when given as an adjunct to oral rehydration therapy. Thiorphan is the active metabolite of racecadotril.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Secnidazole	Secnidazole	71815		R3459K699K	3366-95-8		Oral		Secnidazole (trade names Flagentyl, Sindose, Secnil) is a nitroimidazole anti-infective. Effectiveness in the treatment of dientamoebiasis has been reported. It has also been tested against Atopobium vaginae. Secnidazole is structurally related to the commonly used 5-nitroimidazoles metronidazole and tinidazole. These drugs share a common spectrum of activity against anaerobic micro-organisms and they appear particularly effective in the treatment of amoebiasis, giardiasis, trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis. Secnidazole is rapidly and completely absorbed after oral administration and has a longer terminal elimination half-life (approximately 17 to 29 hours) than commonly used drugs in this class. In patients with intestinal amoebiasis or giardiasis, clinical or parasistological cure rates of 80 to 100% are achieved after treatment with a single dose of secnidazole 2 g (30 mg/kg in children), similar to the response rates achieved with multiple dosage regimens of metronidazole or tinidazole. Patients with hepatic amoebiasis appears to respond well to 5- to 7-day therapy with secnidazole, but the efficacy of this drug regimen requires further evaluation in larger numbers of patients. After administration of a single dose of secnidazole, parasitological eradication was achieved in approximately 92 to 100% of patients with urogenital trichomoniasis. Patients with bacteria vaginosis respond at least as well to a single dose of secnidazole as to single-dose tinidazole, or single- or 7-day treatment with metronidazole; clinical improvement and/or microbiological evidence of cure was attained in approximately 59 to 96% of patients. In the clinical trials reviewed, secnidazole was well tolerated; most adverse events were gastrointestinal in nature and did not require treatment intervention or withdrawal from therapy. In summary, available evidence suggests that secnidazole is as efficacious as other 5-nitroimidazole drugs in the treatment of protozoal infections and bacterial vaginosis. The convenience and ease of administration associated with single-dose therapy, combined with a good tolerability profile, make secnidazole a suitable option to other single-dose treatments and an attractive alternative to multiple dosage regimens with other drugs in this class.

It was originally introduced by Bayer in 1963 but anaphylactic reactions caused it to be withdrawn shortly afterwards. Even though Cremophor EL has been shown to cause anaphylactic reactions in humans in several cases (both when given intravenously and orally), it is still debated whether or not propanidid itself may have contributed to the reactions. It has been argued that the toxic effects or reactions to Propanidid were due to the drugs themselves. Several cases of negative reactions have been recorded for different drugs using Cremophor EL as solubilizer. This suggest that the negative reactions were mainly caused by Cremophor and not by the drug substances themselves.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spiramycin	Spiramycin	5356392		71ODY0V87H	8025-81-8				"Spiramycin is a macrolide antibiotic. It is used to treat toxoplasmosis and various other infections of soft tissues. Although used in Europe, Canada and Mexico, spiramycin is still considered an experimental drug in the United States, but can sometimes be obtained by special permission from the FDA for toxoplasmosis in the first trimester of pregnancy. Spiramycin has been used in Europe since the year 2000 under the trade name ""Rovamycine"", produced by Rhone-Poulenc Rorer and Famar Lyon, France and Eczacibasi Ilae, Turkey. It also goes under the name Rovamycine in Canada, where it is mostly marketed to dentists for mouth infections. Spiramycin is a 16-membered ring macrolide (antibiotic). It was discovered in 1952 as a product of Streptomyces ambofaciens. As a preparation for oral administration it has been used since 1955, in 1987 also the parenteral form was introduced into practice. The antibacterial action involves inhibition of protein synthesis in the bacterial cell during translocation. Resistance to spiramycin can develop by several mechanisms and its prevalence is to a considerable extent proportional to the frequency of prescription in a given area. The antibacterial spectrum comprises Gram-positive cocci and rods, Gram-negative cocci and also Legionellae, mycoplasmas, chlamydiae, some types of spirochetes, Toxoplasma gondii and Cryptosporidium sp. , Enterobacteria, pseudomonads and pathogenic moulds are resistant. Its action is mainly bacteriostatic, on highly sensitive strains it exerts a bactericide action. As compared with erythromycin, it is in vitro weight for weight 5 to 20 less effective, an equipotential therapeutic dose is, however, only double. This difference between the effectiveness in vitro and in vivo is explained above all by the great affinity of spiramycin to tissues where it achieves concentrations many times higher than serum levels. An important part is played also by the slow release of the antibiotic from the tissue compartment, the marked action on microbes in sub-inhibition concentrations and the relatively long persisting post-antibiotic effect. Its great advantage is the exceptionally favourable tolerance-gastrointestinal and general. It is available for parenteral and oral administration"

GBR-12909 binds to the target site on the DAT ~ 500 times more strongly than cocaine, but simultaneously inhibits the release of dopamine. This combined effect only slightly elevates dopamine levels, giving vanoxerine only mild stimulant effects. Vanoxerine has been researched for use in treating cocaine dependence both as a substitute for cocaine and to block the rewarding effects. This strategy of using a competing agonist with a longer half-life has been successfully used to treat addiction to opiates such as heroin by substituting with methadone. It was hoped that vanoxerine would be of similar use in treating cocaine addiction. Research also indicates that vanoxerine may have additional mechanisms of action including antagonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, and it has also been shown to reduce the consumption of alcohol in animal models of alcohol abuse. Vanoxerine has been through human trials up to Phase II, but development was halted after it was shown to cause long QT syndrome. However, GBR 12909 has not yet been completely abandoned and it appears hopeful new analogs are ""around the corner"". As an example, GBR compounds are piperazine based and contain a proximal and a distal nitrogen. It was found that piperidine analogs are still fully active DRIs, although they don't have any affinity for the ""piperazine binding site"" unlike the GBR compounds. Further SAR revealed that while there are 4 atoms connecting the two fluorophenyl rings to the piperazine, the ether in the chain could be omitted in exchange for a tertiary nitrogen."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zosuquidar	Zosuquidar	153997		AB5K82X98Y	167354-41-8				"Zosuquidar is a compound of antineoplastic drug candidates currently under development. It is now in ""Phase 3"" of clinical tests in the United States. Its action mechanism consists of the inhibition of P-glycoproteins; other drugs with this mechanism include tariquidar and laniquidar. P-glycoproteins are proteins which convert the energy derived from the hydrolysis of ATP to structural changes in protein molecules, in order to perform coupling, thus discharging medicine from cells. If P-glycoprotein coded with the MDR1 gene manifests itself in cancer cells, it discharges much of the antineoplastic drugs from the cells, making cancer cells medicine tolerant, and rendering antineoplastic drugs ineffective. This protein also manifests itself in normal organs not affected by the cancer (such as the liver, small intestine, and skin cells in blood vessels of the brain), and participates in the transportation of medicine. The compound Zosuquidar inhibits this P-glycoprotein, causing the cancer cells to lose their medicine tolerance, and making antineoplastic drugs effective."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-Androstenediol	5-Androstenediol	10634		95PS51EMXY	521-17-5				5-Androstenediol (androst-5-ene-3Î²,17Î²-diol or 5-AED) is one of two androstenediols, the other being 4-androstenediol. 5-Androstenediol is a direct metabolite of the most abundant steroid produced by the human adrenal cortex, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA). 5-Androstenediol is less androgenic than 4-androstenediol, and stimulates the immune system. When administered to rats in vivo, 5-androstenediol has approximately 1/70 the androgenicity of DHEA, 1/185 the androgenicity of androstenedione, and 1/475 the androgenicity of testosterone.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AMPT	AMPT	3125		X88TTO174Z	658-48-0				Alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) is a tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor. Alpha-methyl-p-tyrosine (AMPT) is a non-endogenous drug involved in the catecholamine biosynthetic pathway. AMPT inhibits tyrosine hydroxylase whose enzymatic activity is regulated through the phosphorylation of different serine residue regulatory domain sites. Catecholamine biosynthesis starts with dietary tyrosine, which is hydroxylated by the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase. It is hypothesized that AMPT competes with tyrosine at the tyrosine-binding site, causing inhibition of tyrosine hydroxylase. It has been used in the treatment of pheochromocytoma. It has been demonstrated to inhibit the production of melanin.

Its effects are similar to the drug disulfiram (Antabuse) in that it interferes with the normal metabolism of alcohol by preventing the breakdown of the metabolic byproduct acetaldehyde. The result is that when alcohol is consumed by users of calcium carbimide, they experience severe reactions which include symptoms such as sweating, difficulty breathing, rapid heartbeat, rash, nausea and vomiting, and headache. A recent 9-year study found that incorporation of supervised carbimide and the similar drug, disulfiram, into a comprehensive treatment program resulted in an abstinence rate of over 50%.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metofoline	Metofoline	16538		72L4ZT2W1P	2154-02-1				Methopholine is an opioid analgesic drug discovered in the 1950s by a team of Swiss researchers at Hoffmann-La Roche. Methopholine is an isoquinoline derivative which is not structurally related to most other opioids. It has around the same efficacy as an analgesic as codeine, and was evaluated for the treatment of postoperative pain. Methopholine tablets were marketed in the United States under the brand name of Versidyne, but the drug was withdrawn from the market in 1965 due to the occurrence of ophthalmic side-effects and the discovery that it could produce corneal opacities in dogs. Methopholine has two enantiomers, with the levo (R) enantiomer being the active form, around 3x the potency of codeine, and the (S) enantiomer being inactive. Analogues where the 4'-chloro group has been replaced by other groups have also been tested, the fluoro derivative being slightly more potent than chloro, and the nitro derivative being most potent of all, with the racemic 4'-nitromethopholine being around 20x the potency of codeine.

It is also known by its street names ""U4Euh"" (""Euphoria"") and ""Ice"". It is banned in many countries as a stimulant. 4-Methylaminorex has effects comparable to methamphetamine but with a longer duration. The results of animal experiments conducted with this drug suggest that it has an abuse liability similar to cocaine and amphetamine. One study found that, ""stimulus properties of racemic cis, racemic trans, and all four individual optical isomers of 4-methylaminorex were examined in rats trained to discriminate 1 mg/kg of S(+)amphetamine sulfate from saline. The S(+)amphetamine stimulus generalized to all of the agents investigated"". A second study in which rats trained to discriminate either 0.75Â mg/kg S(+)-amphetamine or 1.5Â mg/kg fenfluramine from saline generalized to aminorex as amphetamine stimulus but not to fenfluramine. Rats trained to discriminate 8Â mg/kg cocaine from saline generalized 4-methylaminorex to cocaine-stimulus. The reinforcing effects of cis-4-methylaminorex were determined in two models of intravenous drug self-administration in primates. Vehicle or 4-methylaminorex doses were substituted for cocaine. One of the two different doses of 4-methylaminorex maintained self-administration behavior above vehicle control levels."

Ohmefentanyl is one of the most potent Î¼ -receptor agonists known, comparable to super-potent opioids such as carfentanil and etorphine which are used for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants in veterinary medicine. In mouse studies, the most active isomer 3R,4S,Î²S-ohmefentanyl was 28 times more powerful as a painkiller than fentanyl, the chemical from which it is derived, and 6300 times more effective than morphine. Ohmefentanyl has three stereogenic centers and so has eight stereoisomers, which are named F9201â€“F9208. Researchers are studying the different pharmaceutical properties of these isomers. The 4""-fluoro analogue (i.e. substituted on the phenethyl ring) of the 3R,4S,Î²S isomer of ohmefentanyl is one of the most potent opioid agonists yet discovered, possessing an analgesic potency approximately 18,000-fold greater than morphine. Other analogues with potency higher than that of ohmefentanyl itself include the 2'-fluoro derivative (i.e. substituted on the aniline phenyl ring), and derivatives where the N-propionyl group was replaced by N-methoxyacetyl or 2-furamide groups, or a carboethoxy group is added to the 4-position of the piperidine ring.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Para-Chloroamphetamine	Para-Chloroamphetamine	3127			64-12-0				para-Chloroamphetamine (PCA), also known as 4-chloroamphetamine (4-CA), is an amphetamine derivative and monoamine releaser similar to MDMA, but with substantially higher neurotoxicity, thought to be due to the unrestrained release of both serotonin and dopamine by a metabolite. It is used as a neurotoxin by neurobiologists to selectively kill serotonergic neurons for research purposes, in the same way that 6-hydroxydopamine is used to kill dopaminergic neurons. This compound does have a history of being used daily as an antidepressant in humans with no mentionable side effects that are particularly worrysome. However, the effects of the compound on experimental animals appear less encouraging. It has nevertheless been detected as an apparent designer drug, along with the related 3-chloroamphetamine, which is even more potent as a releaser of dopamine and serotonin but slightly less neurotoxic.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tricaine_mesylate	Tricaine mesylate	261501			886-86-2				Tricaine mesylate (Tricaine methanesulfonate, TMS, MS-222), is white powder used for anesthesia, sedation, or euthanasia of fish. TMS is the only anesthetic licensed in the United States for fin fish that is intended for human consumption. The drug can have selective toxicity for poikilotherms due to their lower rate of metabolism in the liver. TMS is a muscle relaxant that operates by preventing action potentials. By blocking action potentials, no signals can be exchanged between the brain and the extremities. There will be no sensory input or muscle contractions which would have been caused by action potential, which includes most muscles. The optimum concentration used is 50-75 ppm (parts per million). However, the optimum may vary with the size and species of the fish, and other variables. It is easily soluble in water (both fresh and salt) but it drastically decreases the pH of water, increasing the acidity, which may be toxic for fish. Sodium bicarbonate can be used to buffer the solution to a pH range of 6.5-7.5. Usually an equal amount of buffer is added to attain a neutral pH. In salt/marine/sea water, the buffer use may not be necessary because sea water itself has buffering capacity.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Bromo-LSD	2-Bromo-LSD	10171			478-84-2				2-Bromo-LSD, also known as BOL-148, is a derivative of lysergic acid invented by Albert Hofmann, as part of the original research from which the closely related compound LSD was also derived. 2-bromo-LSD was found to be inactive as a hallucinogen and so was comparatively little researched for many years, although its similar behavior in the body made it useful for radiolabelling studies. It was found to bind to many of the same receptor targets as LSD, but acting as a neutral antagonist rather than an agonist. However its generally similar behavior to LSD in some respects has shown to be very useful in one specific area, the treatment of cluster headaches. These debilitating attacks have been known for some time to be amenable to treatment with certain hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin, but because of the illegal status of these drugs and the kind of mental changes they induce, research into their medical use has been slow and therapeutic application limited to very specific circumstances under strict supervision. It had been thought that this specific therapeutic action against cluster headaches was limited to hallucinogenic drugs of this type, and would always present a major barrier to their clinical use. However a serendipitous discovery found that 2-bromo-LSD is also able to produce this therapeutic effect, despite lacking the other effects of LSD. This has led to a resurgence of interest and research into 2-bromo-LSD and its possible medical uses. Some isolated incidents of hallucinogenic responses have been reported, but as with other non-hallucinogenic LSD analogues such as lisuride, this appears to be a rare side effect occurring only in individuals with an as yet unexplained susceptibility to this reaction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/%CE%92-Methylphenethylamine	Î’-Methylphenethylamine	11398			582-22-9				Î²-Methylphenethylamine (Î²-Me-PEA), or 1-amino-2-phenylpropane, is an organic compound of the phenethylamine class, and a positional isomer of the drug amphetamine, with which it shares some properties. In appearance, it is a colorless or yellowish liquid. Relatively little information has been published about this substance. Hartung and Munch reported that it had good pressor activity in experimental animals, and that it was orally active. The MLD (minimum lethal dose) for the HCl salt was given as 500 mg/kg (rat, s.c. ) and 50 mg/kg (rabbit, i.v.). A study by Graham and co-workers at the Upjohn Co. , comparing a large number of Î²-methylphenethylamines substituted on the benzene ring showed that Î²-methylphenethylamine itself had 1/700 x the pressor activity of epinephrine, corresponding to ~ 1/3 the potency of amphetamine. The Î²-methyl compound also had ~ 2 x the broncho-constricting power of amphetamine (as measured using the isolated rabbit lung), and an LD50 of 50 mg/kg (rat, i.v.).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lithium_orotate	Lithium orotate	23686432			5266-20-6		Oral		Lithium orotate, is a salt of orotic acid and lithium. It is available as the monohydrate, LiC5H3N2O4Â·H2O. In this compound, lithium is non-covalently bound to an orotate ion, rather than to a carbonate or other ion. There are no systematic reviews supporting the efficacy of lithium orotate for any condition. A 1979 study drew the mistaken conclusion that its use may in fact be harmful to kidney function compared to lithium carbonate. According to researcher Vickie Gunther, the study failed to take into account that much less lithium orotate is needed because of its higher efficacy verses lithium carbonate. A fairer comparison would have been to administer 8 times less lithium orotate than lithium carbonate, thereby lessening concerns of potential impaired kidney function. Lithium orotate has been promoted as an alternative to lithium carbonate, which because it must be used in high doses, is potentially toxic. Lithium orotate is heavily touted by Dr. John Gray, among others, as a low toxicity alternative. It is sometimes marketed as a dietary supplement used in small doses to treat certain medical conditions, including stress, bipolar disorder, alcoholism, ADHD, ADD, aggression, PTSD, Alzheimer's and to improve memory. Lithium orotate is sold under a wide variety of brand names and is available at some drugstores and health food stores. Although a few psychiatrists prescribe lithium orotate to their patients, it is most often naturopaths and other alternative health practitioners who recommend this lithium compound to their patients.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spironolactone	Spironolactone	5833	DB00421	27O7W4T232	52-01-7		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	"Spironolactone, commonly referred to simply as ""spiro"", and marketed primarily under the brand name Aldactone in most countries, is a synthetic, steroidal antimineralocorticoid agent with additional antiandrogen and weak progestogen properties, as well as some indirect estrogen and glucocorticoid effects, which is used primarily as a diuretic and antihypertensive, but also for the purpose of reducing elevated or unwanted androgen activity in the body. It acts predominantly as a competitive antagonist of the aldosterone (or mineralocorticoid) receptor, and belongs to a class of pharmaceutical drugs known as potassium-sparing diuretics. Spironolactone is a relatively old drug, having been introduced clinically in 1959. It has been predicted that spironolactone will be superseded in cardiovascular conditions by the newer agents such as the structurally related compound eplerenone, which is also an aldosterone antagonist but is selective and lacks many of the actions and side effects of spironolactone, and as such is much more tolerable in comparison. However, spironolactone is still far more widely used than eplerenone. Spironolactone nonetheless still finds frequent use as an antiandrogen."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zidovudine	Zidovudine	35370	DB00495	4B9XT59T7S	30516-87-1		Oral, Serum, Suppository	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Zidovudine or azidothymidine (AZT) (also called ZDV) is a nucleoside analog reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI), a type of antiretroviral drug used for the treatment of HIV/AIDS infection. AZT is the first U.S. government-approved treatment for HIV therapy, prescribed under the name Retrovir. AZT was the first breakthrough in AIDS therapy, significantly reducing the replication of the virus in patients and leading to clinical and immunologic improvements. It can also be used to prevent HIV transmission, such as from mother to child during the period of birth or after a needle stick. Used by itself in HIV-infected patients, AZT safely slows HIV replication in patients, but generally does not stop it entirely. This may allow HIV to become AZT-resistant over time, and for this reason AZT is usually used in conjunction with the other anti-HIV drugs in combination therapy called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). To simplify its use in combination, AZT is included in Combivir and Trizivir, among others. Zidovudine is included in the World Health Organization's Model List of Essential Medicines, which suggests the minimum medicinal needs for a basic health care system.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Baclofen	Baclofen	2284	DB00181	H789N3FKE8	1134-47-0		Oral, intrathecal	85	Baclofen (brand names Kemstro, Lioresal, Liofen, Gablofen, and Beklo) is a derivative of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is primarily used to treat spasticity and is in the early research stages for use for the treatment of alcoholism. It is also used by compounding pharmacies in topical pain creams as a muscle relaxant. It is an agonist for the GABAB receptors. Its beneficial effects in spasticity result from actions at spinal and supraspinal sites. Baclofen can also be used to treat hiccups, and has been shown to prevent rises in body temperature induced by the drug MDMA in rats. In addition, research has shown baclofen to be effective in the treatment of alcohol dependence and withdrawal, by inhibiting both withdrawal symptoms and cravings. A beneficial property of baclofen is that tolerance does not seem to occur to a significant degree â€” baclofen retains its therapeutic anti-spasmodic effects even after many years of continued use. Newer studies, however, indicate that tolerance may develop in some patients receiving intrathecal baclofen treatment. Oral dosage must be carefully regulated; significantly high doses of the drug, particularly 80Â mg per day or higher, can cause excessive ataxia and/or drowsiness that can interfere with daily function.

Possible side effects include dizziness, lightheadedness, malaise, nausea, vomiting, and liver dysfunction. Used with acetaminophen it has added risk of hepatoxicity, which is why the combination is not recommended. It can also be administered for acute pain in general and for tension headache (muscle contraction headache).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flunitrazepam	Flunitrazepam	3380	DB01544	620X0222FQ	1622-62-4		Oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Flunitrazepam, also known as Narcozep, Rohypnol, Rohipnol, Roipnol, Rufinol, or in the common vernacular, simply Roofies, is an intermediate acting benzodiazepine used as hypnotic, sedative, anticonvulsant, anxiolytic and skeletal muscle relaxant drug. In general, the prescription of flunitrazepam as a hypnotic is intended to be for short-term treatment of chronic or severe insomniacs not responsive to other hypnotics, especially in inpatients. It is considered to be one of the most effective benzodiazepine hypnotics on a dose basis. Just as with other hypnotics, flunitrazepam should be used only on a short-term basis or in those with chronic insomnia on an occasional basis. Flunitrazepam is classed as a nitro-benzodiazepine. It is the fluorinated methylamino derivative of nitrazepam. Other nitro-benzodiazepines include nitrazepam â€” the parent compound â€” and clonazepam, the chlorinated derivative. Flunitrazepam has been referred to as a date rape drug because of its high potency, strong effects and the ability to cause strong amnesia during its duration of action. However, Robertson's study indicated that flunitrazepam was used in only around 1% of reported date rapes and 0.33% according to urine lab tests done by El Sohly.

It is usually the drug of choice within the class because it is better absorbed, following oral administration, than other Î²-lactam antibiotics. Amoxicillin is one of the most common antibiotics prescribed for children. The drug became available in 1972. Amoxicillin is susceptible to degradation by Î²-lactamase-producing bacteria, which are resistant to a broad spectrum of Î²-lactam antibiotics, such as penicillin. For this reason, it is often combined with clavulanic acid, a Î²-lactamase inhibitor. This increases effectiveness by reducing its susceptibility to Î²-lactamase resistance.

It is a drug that may improve the prognosis in patients with congestive heart failure. Amrinone has been shown to increase the contractions initiated in the heart by high gain calcium induced calcium release (CICR). The positive inotropic effect of amrinone is mediated by the selective enhancement of high gain CICR which contributes to the contraction of myocytes by phosphorylation through cAMP dependent protein kinase A (PKA) and Ca calmodulin kinase pathways.

It is historically a morphine decomposition product by boiling with concentrated acid, hence the -morphine suffix. Apomorphine does not actually contain morphine or its skeleton, or bind to opioid receptors. The apo- prefix relates to it being an aporphine derivative. Historically, apomorphine has been tried for a variety of uses including psychiatric treatment of homosexuality in the early 20th century, and more recently in treating erectile dysfunction. Currently, apomorphine is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is a potent emetic (i.e. , it induces vomiting) and should not be administered without an antiemetic such as domperidone. The emetic properties of apomorphine are exploited in veterinary medicine to induce therapeutic emesis in canines that have recently ingested toxic or foreign substances. It was also successfully used as an unofficial treatment of heroin addiction, a purpose for which it was championed by the author William S. Burroughs. A recent study indicates that apomorphine might be a suitable marker for assessing central dopamine system alterations associated with chronic heroin consumption. There is, however, no clinical evidence that apomorphine is an effective and safe treatment regimen for opiate addiction. Early studies involved aversion therapy in alcoholism and anxiety, and modern reports are rather anecdotal. For treatment of erectile dysfunction, it is believed that dopamine receptors in the hypothalamic region of the brain are the main target, as dopamine receptors in the penis do facilitate erection, they do so far more weakly than those in the brain.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aspirin	Aspirin	2244	DB00945	R16CO5Y76E	50-78-2		Most commonly oral, also rectal, lysine acetylsalicylate may be given IV or IM	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Aspirin, also known as acetylsalicylic acid, is a salicylate drug, often used as an analgesic to relieve minor aches and pains, as an antipyretic to reduce fever, and as an anti-inflammatory medication. Aspirin was first isolated by Felix Hoffmann, a chemist with the German company Bayer in 1897. Salicylic acid, the main metabolite of aspirin, is an integral part of human and animal metabolism. While in humans much of it is attributable to diet, a substantial part is synthesized endogenously. Aspirin also has an antiplatelet effect by inhibiting the production of thromboxane, which under normal circumstances binds platelet molecules together to create a patch over damaged walls of blood vessels. Because the platelet patch can become too large and also block blood flow, locally and downstream, aspirin is also used long-term, at low doses, to help prevent heart attacks, strokes, and blood clot formation in people at high risk of developing blood clots. It has also been established that low doses of aspirin may be given immediately after a heart attack to reduce the risk of another heart attack or of the death of cardiac tissue. Aspirin may be effective at preventing certain types of cancer, particularly colorectal cancer. The main undesirable side effects of aspirin taken by mouth are gastrointestinal ulcers, stomach bleeding, and tinnitus, especially in higher doses. In children and adolescents, aspirin is no longer indicated to control flu-like symptoms or the symptoms of chickenpox or other viral illnesses, because of the risk of Reye's syndrome. Aspirin is part of a group of medications called nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), but differs from most other NSAIDs in the mechanism of action. Though it, and others in its group called the salicylates, have similar effects (antipyretic, anti-inflammatory, analgesic) to the other NSAIDs and inhibit the same enzyme cyclooxygenase, aspirin (but not the other salicylates) does so in an irreversible manner and, unlike others, affects more the COX-1 variant than the COX-2 variant of the enzyme. Today, aspirin is one of the most widely used medications in the world, with an estimated 40,000 tonnes of it being consumed each year. In countries where Aspirin is a registered trademark owned by Bayer, the generic term is acetylsalicylic acid (ASA).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atenolol	Atenolol	2249	DB00335	50VV3VW0TI	29122-68-7		Oral or IV	Hepatic <10%	Atenolol is a selective Î²1 receptor antagonist, a drug belonging to the group of beta blockers (sometimes written Î²-blockers), a class of drugs used primarily in cardiovascular diseases. Introduced in 1976, atenolol was developed as a replacement for propranolol in the treatment of hypertension. The chemical works by slowing down the heart and reducing its workload. Unlike propranolol, atenolol does not pass through the bloodâ€“brain barrier thus avoiding various central nervous system side effects. Atenolol is one of the most widely used Î²-blockers in the United Kingdom and was once the first-line treatment for hypertension. The role for Î²-blockers in hypertension was downgraded in June 2006 in the United Kingdom to fourth-line, as they perform less appropriately or effectively than newer drugs, particularly in the elderly.

It is a secondary metabolite of these plants and serves as a drug with a wide variety of effects. In general, atropine counters the ""rest and digest"" activity of all muscles and glands regulated by the parasympathetic nervous system. This occurs because atropine is a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (acetylcholine being the main neurotransmitter used by the parasympathetic nervous system). Atropine dilates the pupils, increases heart rate, and reduces salivation and other secretions. Atropine is a core medicine in the World Health Organization's ""Essential Drugs List"", which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system."

It can also be used to form an inner anticoagulant surface on various experimental and medical devices such as test tubes and renal dialysis machines. Although it is used principally in medicine for anticoagulation, its true physiological role in the body remains unclear, because blood anti-coagulation is achieved mostly by heparan sulfate proteoglycans derived from endothelial cells. Heparin is usually stored within the secretory granules of mast cells and released only into the vasculature at sites of tissue injury. It has been proposed that, rather than anticoagulation, the main purpose of heparin is defense at such sites against invading bacteria and other foreign materials. In addition, it is conserved across a number of widely different species, including some invertebrates that do not have a similar blood coagulation system.

Metaxalone (marketed by King Pharmaceuticals under the brand name Skelaxin) is a muscle relaxant used to relax muscles and relieve pain caused by strains, sprains, and other musculoskeletal conditions. Its exact mechanism of action is not known, but it may be due to general central nervous system depression. It is considered to be a moderately strong muscle relaxant, with relatively low incidence of side effects. Skelaxin is available in an 800Â mg scored tablet. Possible side effects include nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and CNS side effects, such as dizziness, headache, and irritability. Metaxalone exhibits increased bioavailability when taken with food. Specifically, in one study, compared to fasted conditions, the presence of food at the time of drug administration increased Cmax by 77.5%, AUC0-t by 23.5%, and AUC0-âˆž by 15.4%. Thus, based on the information in the labeling, patients receiving metaxalone therapy are directed to take metaxalone with food, and are informed that taking metaxalone with food results in an increase in the oral bioavailability of metaxalone compared to taking metaxalone without food. The metabolism of metaxalone involves the liver cytochrome P450 system. Based on the information in the labeling, patients receiving metaxalone therapy and physicians prescribing metaxalone are directed to take precaution when coadministering it with other medications involving the P450 system. Because of potential for side effects, this drug is on the list for high risk medications in the elderly.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pinazepam	Pinazepam	40391	?	5286RBZ882	52463-83-9		Oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Pinazepam (marketed under the brand name Domar and Duna) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Pinazepam and its metabolite N-desmethyldiazepam are transferred to the developing fetus in utero, but the plasma drug level in the mother is usually significantly higher than in the fetus. Pinazepam differs from other benzodiazepines in that it has a propargyl group at the N-1 position of the benzodiazepine structure. It is less toxic than diazepam and in animal studies it appears to produce anxiolytic and anti-agitation properties with limited hypnotic and motor coordination impairing properties. Pinazepam is rapidly absorbed after oral administration. The main active metabolites of pinazepam are depropargylpinazepam and oxazepam. In humans pinazepam acts as a pure anxiolytic agent in that it does not possess to any significant degree the other pharmacological characteristics of benzodiazepines. Its lack of intellectual, motor and hypnotic impairing effects makes it more appropriate than other benzodiazepines for day time use. The elimination half-life is longer in the elderly.

It was sold from 1957 until 1962, when it was withdrawn after being found to be a teratogen, which caused many different forms of birth defects. The negative effects of thalidomide led to the development of more structured drug regulations and control over drug use and development. Modern uses of thalidomide include treating multiple myeloma in combination with dexamethasone, treating erythema nodosum leprosum, and alleviating symptoms of HIV, with strict controls to prevent birth defects. Research is ongoing in its use to treat other cancers and autoimmune conditions, although its use is controversial.

It is in the methylxanthine class of chemical compounds, which also includes the similar compounds theophylline and caffeine. (In caffeine, the only difference is that the NH group of theobromine is an N-CH3 group. ) Despite its name, the compound contains no bromineâ€”theobromine is derived from Theobroma, the name of the genus of the cacao tree, (which itself is made up of the Greek roots theo and broma, meaning ""food of the gods"") with the suffix -ine given to alkaloids and other basic nitrogen-containing compounds. Theobromine is a slightly water-soluble (330 mg/L), crystalline, bitter powder; the colour has been listed as either white or colourless. It has a similar, but lesser, effect than caffeine in the human nervous system, making it a lesser homologue. Theobromine is an isomer of theophylline, as well as paraxanthine. Theobromine is categorized as a dimethyl xanthine. Theobromine was first discovered in 1841 in cacao beans by Russian chemist Alexander Voskresensky.

It is a centrally acting Î±2 adrenergic agonist. It is used to treat the spasms, cramping, and tightness of muscles caused by medical problems such as multiple sclerosis, spastic diplegia, back pain, or certain other injuries to the spine or central nervous system. It is also prescribed off-label for migraine headaches, as a sleep aid, and as an anticonvulsant. It is also prescribed for some symptoms of fibromyalgia. Tizanidine has been found to be as effective as other antispasmodic drugs and has superior tolerability to that of baclofen and diazepam. Tizanidine may cause hypotension, so caution is advised when it is used in patients who have a history of orthostatic hypotension. Use caution with this drug as it can be very strong even at the 2Â mg dose. Also use caution when switching from gel cap to tablet form and vice versa. Tizanidine can occasionally cause liver damage, generally the hepatocellular type. Clinical trials show that up to 5% of patients treated with tizanidine had elevated liver function test values, though symptoms disappeared upon withdrawal of the drug. Care should be used when first beginning treatment with tizanidine with regular liver tests for the first 6 months of treatment.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camazepam	Camazepam	37367	DB01489	HZ3XRH03C3	36104-80-0		Oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Camazepam(marketed under the brand names Albego, Limpidon, and Paxor) is a benzodiazepine psychoactive drug which is the dimethyl carbamate ester of temazepam, a metabolite of diazepam. While it possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, skeletal muscle relaxant and hypnotic properties it differs from other benzodiazepines in that its anxiolytic properties are particularly prominent but has comparatively limited anticonvulsant, hypnotic and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. Compared to other benzodiazepines, it has reduced side effects such as impaired cognition, reaction times and coordination. which makes it best suited as an anxiolytic because of these reduced sides effects. With higher doses such as 40Â mg of camazepam, impairments similar to those which occur with other benzodiazepines manifest as disrupted sleep patterns and impaired cognitive performance. Animal studies have shown camazepam and its active metabolites possess anticonvulsant properties. Skin disorders have been reported with use of camazepam however. Camazepam is believed to increase attention. Camazepam unlike other benzodiazepines does not disrupt normal sleep patterns. Camazepam has been shown in animal experiments to have a very low affinity for benzodiazepine receptors compared to other benzodiazepines. Camazepam is almost completely absorbed into the bloodstream after oral administration with 90 percent bioavailability achieved in humans. Camazepam is metabolised into an active metabolite temazepam.

It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, sedative and skeletal muscle relaxant properties. In animal studies it was found to have low toxicity, although in rats evidence of pulmonary phospholipidosis occurred with pulmonary foam cells developing with long-term use of very high doses. Its elimination half-life is 51 hours - 103 hours. It's mechanism of action is similar to other benzodiazepines. Ethyl loflazepate also produces an active metabolite which is stronger than the parent compound. Ethyl loflazepate was designed to be a prodrug for descarboxyloflazepate, it's active metabolite. It is the active metabolite which is responsible for most of the pharmacological effects rather than ethyl loflazepate. The main metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are descarbethoxyloflazepate, loflazepate and 3-hydroxydescarbethoxyloflazepate. Accumulation of the active metabolites of ethyl loflazepate are not affected by those with renal failure or impairment. The symptoms of an overdose of ethyl loflazepate include sleepiness, agitation and ataxia. Hypotonia may also occur in severe cases. These symptoms occur much more frequently and severely in children. Death from therapeutic maintenance doses of ethyl loflazepate taken for 2 â€“ 3 weeks has been reported in 3 elderly patients. The cause of death was asphyxia due to benzodiazepine toxicity. High doses of the antidepressant fluvoxamine may potentiate the adverse effects of ethyl loflazepate. Ethyl loflazeplate is commercialized in Mexico, although is not very used, under the trade name Victan. It's officially approved for the following conditions: Anxiety Post-trauma anxiety Anxiety associated with severe neuropathic pain.

It is a selective Î±2A receptor agonist. These receptors are concentrated heavily in the prefrontal cortex and the locus coeruleus, with the potential to improve attention abilities via modulating post-synaptic Î±2A receptors in the prefrontal cortex. Guanfacine lowers both systolic and diastolic blood pressure by activating the central nervous system Î±2A norepinephrine autoreceptors, which results in reduced peripheral sympathetic outflow and thus a reduction in peripheral sympathetic tone. Its side-effects are dose dependent, with practically no dryness of the mouth at doses of 2Â mg and less.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydroxocobalamin	Hydroxocobalamin	6433575	DB00200	Q40X8H422O	13422-51-0		Injectable	Primarily hepatic, cobalamins are absorbed in the ileum and stored in the liver.	Hydroxocobalamin (OHCbl, or B12a) is a natural form, or vitamer, of vitamin B12, a basic member of the cobalamin family of compounds. Hydroxocobalamin is the form of vitamin B12 produced by many bacteria which are used to produce the vitamin commercially. Like other forms of vitamin B12, hydroxocobalamin has an intense red color. It is not a form normally found in the human body, but is easily converted in the body to usable coenzyme forms of vitamin B12. Pharmaceutically, hydroxycobalamin is usually produced as a sterile injectable solution and is used for treatment of the vitamin deficiency, and also (because of its affinity for cyanide ion) as a treatment for cyanide poisoning. Experimentally, it has been tested as a scavenger of nitric oxide. Vitamin B12 is a term that refers to a group of compounds called cobalamins that are available in the human body in a variety of mostly interconvertible forms. Together with folic acid, cobalamins are essential cofactors required for DNA synthesis in cells where chromosomal replication and division are occurringâ€”most notably the bone marrow and myeloid cells. As a cofactor, cobalamins are essential for two cellular reactions: (1) the mitochondrial methylmalonylcoenzyme A mutase conversion of methylmalonic acid (MMA) to succinate, which links lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, and (2) activation of methionine synthase, which is the rate-limiting step in the synthesis of methionine from homocysteine and 5-methyltetrahydrofolate.

It exerts its antiarrhythmic effect by induction of slow inward sodium current, which prolongs action potential and refractory period (physiology) of myocardial cells. Because of its Class III antiarrhythmic activity, there should not be concomitant administration of Class Ia and Class III agents. Ibutilide is marketed as Corvert by Pfizer. Administration resulted in successful heart rhythm control in 31-44% of patients within 90 minutes, with sustained polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in 0.9-2.5% of patients. It appears to show better results in atrial flutter as compared to atrial fibrillation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicardipine	Nicardipine	4474	DB00622	CZ5312222S	55985-32-5		Oral, intravenous		Nicardipine hydrochloride (Cardene) is a medication used to treat high blood pressure and angina. It belongs to the class of calcium channel blockers. Nicardipine is a dihydropyridine calcium-channel blocking agent used for the treatment of vascular disorders such as chronic stable angina, hypertension, and Raynaud's phenomenon. It is available in oral and intravenous formulations. Its mechanism of action and clinical effects closely resemble those of nifedipine and the other dihydropyridines, except that nicardipine is more selective for cerebral and coronary blood vessels. Furthermore, nicardipine does not intrinsically decrease myocardial contractility and may be useful in the management of congestive heart failure. Nicardipine also has a longer half-life than nifedipine. Nicardipine was approved by the FDA in December 1988. The patent for both Cardene and Cardene SR expired in October 1995. It has been used in percutaneous coronary intervention. Nicardipine is also an option for lowering of blood pressure in stroke patients who require blood pressure lowering prior to administration of Alteplase when blood pressure is >185/110. Also may be used during rtPA therapy when blood pressure is >230/120. Nicardipine must be used with caution in patients with renal failure because of possible kidney shutdown. Nicardipine inhibits the transmembrane influx of calcium ions into cardiac muscle and smooth muscle without changing serum calcium concentrations. The contractile processes of cardiac muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions into these cells through specific ion channels. The effects of nicardipine are more selective to vascular smooth muscle than cardiac muscle. In animal models, nicardipine produced relaxation of coronary vascular smooth muscle at drug levels which cause little or no negative inotropic effect.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Almitrine	Almitrine	33887	DB01430	9A1222NBG4	27469-53-0				Almitrine (marketed as Duxil by Servier) is a diphenylmethylpiperazine derivative classified as a respiratory stimulant by the ATC. It enhances respiration by acting as an agonist of peripheral chemoreceptors located on the carotid bodies. The drug increases arterial oxygen tension while decreasing arterial carbon dioxide tension in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. It may also prove useful in the treatment of nocturnal oxygen desaturation without impairing the quality of sleep. A significant literature exists for this compound, including over 60 papers that Medline labels as reviews. The clinical efficacy of almitrine-raubasine combination therapy for age related cerebral disorders and functional rehabilitation after stroke has been reviewed by Allain and BentuÃ©-Ferrer. They summarize two studies in which almitrine-raubasine improved some symptoms significantly more than placebo, especially in vascular cases. Their paper also suggests that other studies have shown a beneficial effect of this compound on neurosensory vascular disorders, specifically chorioretinal dysfunctions (visual symptomatology) and vertigo associated with electronystagmographic modifications. This paper further claims that the dosage and tolerance of the compound have been confirmed in a French multi-center study of 5,361 outpatients.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isoetarine	Isoetarine	3762	DB00221	YV0SN3276Q	530-08-5				"Isoetarine or isoetharine, trade names Bronkosol and Bronkometer, is a selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist. It can be called the ""granddaughter of adrenalin"" in the line of beta-two agonists that gave quick relief for bronchospasm and asthma. Adrenalin or epinephrine was the first of these, and next came Isuprel. Isoetharine was the third drug in this line, thus the third generation or granddaughter of the original. In the western US it was the drug of choice in the late 1970s and early 1980s for nebulization (""breathing treatment"") to relieve airway spasm. It generally gave sharp relief of shortness of breath, starting within two to five minutes after the patient began breathing the nebulized mist. This rapid onset is not as clearly present in later drugs. All of the early beta-two agonist catecholamines used for bronchospasm had strong side effects, with increase in heart rate as the most common and most problematic. This came because its ""beta-two effect"" was not quite as selective as might be hoped. Beta-one receptors appeared to also be stimulated in some patients, causing cardiac and other CNS side effects. With Bronkosol this effect tended to be transient and usually went away within a matter of minutes after the end of the treatment. Increase in blood pressure also occurred in a small but significant percentage of cases, but also was almost invariably transient. By the late 1980s isoetharine was largely replaced in the marketplace by Alupent/metaproterenol, which seemed to have slightly less cardiac side effect and lasted a couple of hours longer. Alupent in turn was replaced by albuterol. Some practitioners still believe that these later aerosolized bronchodilators never gave quite as quick of relief from asthmatic shortness of breath as did Bronkosol. Thus they see a continued specialty role in treatment of severe shortness of breath that does not improve in the first five minutes of albuterol treatment."

It is thought in conditions like irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) the receptors have become faulty or oversensitive. 5HT-3 antagonists work by blocking the nervous and chemical signals from reaching these receptors. Studies have shown that the drug can greatly improve quality of life in men and women with diahorrea predominant IBS Cilansetron is the first 5HT antagonist specifically designed for IBS that is effective in men as well as women. Solvay has had considerable difficulty with the medicines regulators in the UK, EU and USA with regards to licensing the drug. This could possibly be due to the problems discovered after licensing with the drug Lotronex. At time of writing; Solvay had recently withdrawn its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but was continuing its talks with the MHRA in the UK and EU regulators. It is not currently known what sort of timeframe the public are looking at to be able to obtain the drug. This matter is not helped by the lack of information about cilansetron and its trials in the public domain. The regulators have also stated this in their responses. There is no information about future trials currently available. Some people have tried the Anti-emetic ondansetron HCl (Zofran) as a substitute for the time being, results are mixed but noted effect has been shown in some males and females However; due to its license in the UK it is usually only prescribable at consultant level. Since the licensing of a generic version it is more likely an NHS prescription will be accepted as the branded version is very expensive (Official NHS pricing. ) In the USA and Canada: availability often depends on insurance and the doctors personal opinion on off-label prescribing.

Eperisone acts by relaxing both skeletal muscles and vascular smooth muscles, and demonstrates a variety of effects such as reduction of myotonia, improvement of circulation, and suppression of the pain reflex. The drug inhibits the vicious cycle of myotonia by decreasing pain, ischaemia, and hypertonia in skeletal muscles, thus alleviating stiffness and spasticity, and facilitating muscle movement Eperisone also improves dizziness and tinnitus associated with cerebrovascular disorders or cervical spondylosis. Eperisone has a relatively low incidence of sedation when compared with other antispasmodic drugs; this simplifies the clinical application of the drug and makes it an attractive choice for patients who require antispasmodic therapy without a reduction in alertness. Eperisone also facilitates voluntary movement of the upper and lower extremities without reducing muscle power; it is therefore useful during the initial stage of rehabilitation and as a supporting drug during subsequent rehabilitative therapy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talopram	Talopram	23573		5PY881HC79	7182-51-6				Talopram (Lu 3-010), also known as phthalapromine, is a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (NRI) which was researched for the management of depression in the 1960s and 1970s but was never commercialized. Along with talsupram, talopram is structurally related to the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) citalopram, as well as to melitracen: â€œ In 1971, the company hired Klaus BÃ¸gesÃ¸ as a medicinal chemist. Over the years BÃ¸gesÃ¸ turned out to have a Midas touch at the game of drug hunting, creating more molecules that made it to the market than almost any other medicinal chemist in the field. The challenge facing him in 1971 following his recruitment was to produce a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Like other companies at the time, Lundbeck had little interest in an SSRI. BÃ¸gesÃ¸ began from an accident in the laboratory. Trying to create a derivative of their norepinephrine reuptake inhibiting antidepressant melitracen, Lundbeck chemists accidentally produced a new chemical â€“ a phenylphthalene. Against all the odds, just like melitracen, this was also a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. Two potential antidepressants came out of this â€“ talopram and tasulopram, which were pressed into clinical trials. Both however turned out to be energizing, and in a number of cases there were suicide attempts. The fact that there were suicide attempts appeared to confirm another proposal of Paul Kielholz, that activating antidepressants might lead to suicide. Lundbeckâ€™s experience suggested that norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were likely to lead to just this problem. Lundbeck retreated, scared. If norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors were likely to trigger suicide, the greatest hazard of an antidepressant, then Kielholzâ€™s view suggested that an SSRI would be less likely to lead to suicide. BÃ¸gesÃ¸â€™s job was to see whether the new series of drugs could be converted into a series of SSRIs. Following a lead from Carlsson on how to do this, he converted talopram into citalopram, the most selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor to come to the market. â€ﾝ

Zilpaterol is typically fed in the last 3â€“6 weeks of cattle's lives, with a brief period (three days in the US) before death for withdrawal, which allows the drug to mostly leave the animal's tissues. Concerns have been made on the impact on Ziplaterol on flavor, and The FDA states that overall tenderness, juiciness, flavor intensity and beef flavor were all statistically different [in Zilmax-treated beef] compared to controls. However, several studies have shown the use of ziplaterol leads to increased size, feed efficiency, and value. Merck reported Zilmax-fed cattle do not produce beef with a difference in taste or quality compared to cattle not fed the drug, but elsewhere, concerns have been raised about the beef's tenderness.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Halofuginone	Halofuginone	400772		L31MM1385E	55837-20-2				Halofuginone is a coccidiostat used in veterinary medicine. It is a synthetic halogenated derivative of febrifugine, a natural quinazolinone alkaloid which can be found in the Chinese herb Dichroa febrifuga (Chang Shan). Collgard Biopharmaceuticals is developing halofuginone for the treatment of scleroderma and it has received orphan drug designation from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Halofuginone inhibits the development of T helper 17 cells, immune cells that play an important role in autoimmune disease, but it does not affect other kinds of T cells which involved in normal immune function. Halofuginone therefore has potential for the treatment of autoimmune disorders. Halofuginone is also an inhibitor of collagen type I gene expression and as a consequence it may inhibit tumor cell growth. Halofuginone exerts its effects by acting as a high affinity inhibitor of the enzyme Glutamyl-Prolyl tRNA synthetase. Inhibition of prolyl tRNA charging leads to the accumulation of uncharged prolyl tRNAs, which serve as a signal to initiate the amino acid starvation response, which in turn exerts anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic effects.

It was produced in 1961 by Merck Laboratories by bonding 2 vitamin B6 compounds (pyridoxine) together with a disulfide bridge. Since the 1970s, it has been a prescription and OTC drug in several countries for cognitive disorders and learning disorders in children. Since the early 1990s it has been sold as a nootropic dietary supplement in the United States. It is approved for ""symptomatic treatment of chronically impaired brain function in dementia syndromes"" and for ""supportive treatment of sequelae of craniocerebral trauma"" in various European countries, including Austria, Germany, France, Italy, Portugal, and Greece. In France it is also approved for rheumatoid arthritis as a disease modifying drug, on the basis of the results of clinical trials. It is not licensed for use in the United Kingdom, but in many countries it is available over the counter and is widely advertised on the internet as being for ""memory disturbances. "" From the known sales data, it is estimated that more than 100 000 individuals in European Union countries have taken pyritinol in the past five years. One small study, with 12 subjects given pyritinol, showed an improvement in performance on tests of reaction time, but not on memory tests. Some studies have found large doses of Pyritinol can help to reduce hangovers. Common dosages are 100-1,600 mg daily, taken in 1-3 doses during the day."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Silibinin	Silibinin	31553		4RKY41TBTF	22888-70-6				Silibinin, also known as silybin, is the major active constituent of silymarin, a standardized extract of the milk thistle seeds containing mixture of flavonolignans consisting of among others of silibinin, isosilibinin, silicristin, and silidianin. Silibinin itself is mixture of two diastereomers silibinin A and silybinin B in approximately equimolar ratio. Both in vitro and animal research suggest that silibinin has hepatoprotective (antihepatotoxic) properties that protect liver cells against toxins. Silibinin has also demonstrated in vitro anti-cancer effects against human prostate adenocarcinoma cells, estrogen-dependent and -independent human breast carcinoma cells, human ectocervical carcinoma cells, human colon cancer cells, and both small and nonsmall human lung carcinoma cells. Chemically modified silibinin, silibinin dihydrogen disuccinate disodium (trade name Legalon SIL) a solution for injection, is currently being tested as a treatment of severe intoxications with hepatotoxic substances, such as death cap (Amanita phalloides) poisoning. There is also clinical evidence for the use of silibinin as a supportive element in alcoholic and Child grade â€˜Aâ€™ liver cirrhosis.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bretazenil	Bretazenil	107926		OSZ0E9DGOJ	84379-13-5				Bretazenil (Ro16-6028) is an imidazopyrrolobenzodiazepine anxiolytic drug which is derived from the benzodiazepine family, and was invented in 1988. It is most closely related in structure to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, although its effects are somewhat different. It is classed as a high-potency benzodiazepine due to its high affinity binding to benzodiazepine binding sites where it acts as a partial agonist. Its profile as a partial agonist and preclinical trial data suggests that it may have a reduced adverse effect profile. In particular bretazenil has been proposed to cause a less strong development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. Bretazenil differs from traditional 1,4 benzodiazepines by being a partial agonist and because it binds to alpha,1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 subunit containing GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes. 1,4 benzodiazepines bind only to alpha 1, 2, 3 and 5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carisbamate	Carisbamate	9942577		P7725I9V3Z	194085-75-1				Carisbamate (YKP 509, proposed trade name Comfyde) is an experimental anticonvulsant drug under development by Johnson & Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development. In 1998, the compound was in-licensed from SK Corp. (currently Life Science Business Division of SK Holdings), a South Korean company. A phase II clinical trial in the treatment of partial seizures demonstrated that the compound has efficacy in the treatment of partial seizures and a good safety profile. Since late 2006, the compound has been undergoing a large multicenter phase III clinical trial for the treatment of partial seizures. Its mechanism of action is unknown. On October 24, 2008, Johnson & Johnson announced that it had submitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for carisbamate. Carisbamate has received provisional approval by the FDA to be marketed under the brand name of Comfyde. However, on August 21, 2009, Johnson & Johnson reported that the FDA had failed to give marketing approval. A double-blind, placebo-controlled trial cf carisbamate in 323 patients with migraine failed to demonstrate that the active drug was more effective than placebo. However, carisbamate was well tolerated at doses up to 600Â mg/day.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihydrexidine	Dihydrexidine	5311070		32D64VH037	137417-08-4				Dihydrexidine (DAR-0100) is a moderately selective full agonist at the dopamine D1 and D5 receptors. It has approximately 10-fold selectivity for D1 and D5 over the D2 receptor. Although dihydrexidine has some affinity for the D2 receptor, it has functionally selective D2 signaling, thereby explaining why it lacks D2 agonist behavioral qualities. Dihydrexidine has shown impressive antiparkinson effects in the MPTP-primate model, and has been investigated for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. In an early clinical trial the drug was given intravenously and led to profound hypotension so development was halted. The drug was resurrected when it was shown that smaller subcutaneous doses were safe. This led to a pilot study in schizophrenia and current clinical trials to assess its efficacy in improving the cognitive and working memory deficits in schizophrenia and schizotypal disorder. There have been several reviews of relevance to the compound.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/3-Methylfentanyl	3-Methylfentanyl	61996	DB01571		42045-86-3				3-Methylfentanyl (3-MF, mefentanyl) is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of fentanyl. 3-Methylfentanyl is one of the most potent drugs that has been widely sold on the black market, estimated to be between 400-6000 times stronger than morphine depending on which isomer is used (with the cis isomers being the more potent one). 3-Methylfentanyl was first discovered in 1974 and subsequently appeared on the street as an alternative to the clandestinely produced fentanyl analogue Î±-methylfentanyl. However, it quickly became apparent that 3-methylfentanyl was much more potent than Î±-methylfentanyl, and correspondingly even more dangerous. While 3-methylfentanyl was initially sold on the black market for only a short time between 1984â€“1985, its high potency made it an attractive target to clandestine drug producers, as racemic 3-MF is 10â€“15 times more potent than fentanyl and so correspondingly larger amounts of cut product for street sales can be produced for an equivalent amount of effort as for producing fentanyl itself; one gram of 3-methylfentanyl might be sufficient to produce several thousand dosage units once diluted for sale. 3-MF has thus reappeared several times, at various places around the world, and is currently a problematic drug of abuse in Scandinavian and Eastern European countries such as Finland and Estonia. Other opioid analogues even more potent still than 3-MF are known, such as carfentanil and ohmefentanyl, but these are significantly more difficult to manufacture than 3-methylfentanyl and have not been so well accepted as street drugs. 3-Methylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl, but is far more potent due to increased binding affinity to its target site. Since fentanyl itself is already highly potent, 3-methylfentanyl is extremely dangerous when used recreationally, and has resulted in many deaths among recreational opioid users ingesting the drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening.

It is the Î²-methoxy analogue of methylenedioxyphenethylamine (MDPEA), and is also more distantly related to methylone. On account of its similarity to norepinephrine, the effects of BOH may be of a purely adrenergic nature. BOH was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL, the dosage range is listed as 80â€“120Â mg, and the duration listed as 6â€“8 hours. Shulgin reports that BOH causes slight warmth, mydriasis, anorexia, mild nausea, and cold feet, with no psychedelic, entactogen, or euphoriant effects. He gives it a ++ on the Shulgin Rating Scale. Very little is known about the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, effects, and toxicity of BOH.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Caffeine_citrate	Caffeine citrate	6241			69-22-7		Oral, i.v.		Caffeine citrate (Cafcit) is a citrate salt of caffeine, with the chemical formula of C14H18N4O9 sometimes used in medical treatment, including short-term treatment of apnea of prematurity. Caffeine citrate functions in much the same capacity as does caffeine, but takes effect more quickly; its speed of dissociation is faster than that of caffeine. Like its sister compound, it can be used to dispel pain from a headache. However, caffeine citrate is typically only used to treat severe migraines. The drug is prepared simply by combining anhydrous caffeine with citric acid monohydrate and sodium citrate dihydrate. In method of action, the preparation is exactly identical to that of caffeine base as the citrate counter ion dissociates in water. Doses of caffeine citrate, due to the added weight of the citrate moiety, are understandably higher than with caffeine base, i.e. , it takes a larger dose to get the same amount of caffeine. The ratio of therapeutic doses of caffeine base to its citrate salt is typically 1:2. It is therefore generally recommended that caffeine is prescribed in terms of caffeine base, and not caffeine citrate.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/R-4066	R-4066	380029			101564-56-1				R-4066 is a drug which is an analogue of the opioid analgesic methadone, where the metabolically labile dimethylamino group has been replaced by a piperidinospiro group. Developed by Janssen Pharmacutica, it is around 212x more potent than methadone as an analgesic in animal tests, with an effective oral dosage of 0.07Â mg/kg, but is slightly shorter acting, with a duration of action of around 3 hours. If the ketone function is reduced and acetylated, the (R) isomer of the resultant compound is equipotent and has an analgesic duration of 20.5 hours compared to 8 hours for methadone. R-4066 has never been used in humans, but would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SB-334,867	SB-334,867	6604926			249889-64-3				SB-334,867 is an orexin antagonist. It was the first non-peptide antagonist developed that is selective for the orexin receptor subtype OX1, with around 50x selectivity for OX1 over OX2 receptors. It has been shown to produce sedative and anorectic effects in animals, and has been useful in characterising the orexinergic regulation of brain systems involved with appetite and sleep, as well as other physiological processes. Orexin antagonists have multiple potential clinical applications including the treatment of drug addiction, insomnia, obesity and diabetes.

It is used to study the role of this receptor subtype in the release of dopamine and noradrenaline in the brain, and has also been used as a lead compound to derive a number of other selective nicotinic receptor ligands.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/3,4-Dichloroamphetamine	3,4-Dichloroamphetamine	17535			4806-87-5				3,4-Dichloroamphetamine (DCA), is an amphetamine derived drug invented by Eli Lilly in the 1960s, which has a number of pharmacological actions. It acts as a highly potent and selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) and binds to the serotonin transporter with high affinity, but also acts as a selective serotonergic neurotoxin in a similar manner to the related para-chloroamphetamine, though with slightly lower potency. It is also a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), as well as a very potent inhibitor of the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyl transferase which normally functions to transform noradrenaline into adrenaline in the body.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-2389	AM-2389	49783410			1256842-49-5				AM-2389 is a classical cannabinoid derivative which acts as a potent and reasonably selective agonist for the CB1 receptor, with a Ki of 0.16 nM, and 26x selectivity over the related CB2 receptor. It has high potency in animal tests of cannabinoid activity, and a medium duration of action. Replacing the 1',1'-dimethyl substitution of the dimethylheptyl side chain of classical cannabinoids with cyclopropyl or cyclopentyl results in higher potency than cyclobutyl, but only the cyclobutyl derivatives show selectivity for CB1 over CB2. High selectivity for CB1 over CB2 is difficult to achieve, as almost all commonly used CB1 agonists have similar or greater affinity for CB2 than CB1, and the only truly highly selective CB1 agonists known as of 2012 are eicosanoid derivatives such as O-1812.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-6545	AM-6545	46912919			1245626-05-4				AM-6545 is a drug which acts as a peripherally selective silent antagonist for the CB1 receptor, and was developed for the treatment of obesity. Other cannabinoid antagonists such as rimonabant have been marketed for this application, but have subsequently been withdrawn from sale because of centrally mediated side effects such as depression and nausea. Because AM-6545 does not cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier to any significant extent, it does not produce these kind of side effects, but has still been shown to effectively reduce appetite and food consumption in animal studies.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Axomadol	Axomadol	10221318			187219-95-0				Axomadol is a synthetic, centrally-acting analgesic which was under investigation by Endo Pharmaceuticals in collaboration with GrÃ¼nenthal for the treatment of chronic, moderate to severe lower back pain and arthrosis. Development was halted after phase II clinical trials as it did not meet the pre-determined clinical endpoints.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Biphalin	Biphalin	5487663			83916-01-2				Biphalin is a dimeric enkephalin endogenous peptide (Tyr--Ala-Gly-Phe-NH)2 composed of two tetrapeptides derived from enkephalins, connected 'tail-to-tail' by a hydrazide bridge. The presence of two distinct pharmacophore confers of Biphalin highly affinity for both Î¼ and Î´ opioid receptors (with a with an EC50 of about 1-5 nM for both Î¼ and Î´ receptors), therefore it has analgesic activity. Biphalin presents a considerable antinociceptive profile. In fact, when administered intracerebroventricularly in mice, biphalin displays a potency almost 7-fold greater than that of the ultra-potent alkaloid agonist, etorphine and 7000-fold greater than morphine, and biphalin and morphine were found to be equipotent after intraperitoneal administration. The extraordinary in vivo potency showed by this compound is coupled with low side-effects, in particular to produce no dependency in chronic use. For these reasons, several efforts have been carried out in order to obtain more informations about structure-activity relationship. Results clarely indicates that at least for Î¼ receptor binding the presence of two pharmacophores is not necessary; Tyr is indipensable for analgesic activity, while replacing Phe at the position 4 and 4' with non-aromatic, but lipophylic amino acids does not greatly change the binding proprieties and in general 4,4' positions are found to be important to design biphalin analogues with increased potency and modified Î¼/Î´ selectivity. The hydrazide linker is not fundamental for activity or binding, and it can be conveniently substituted by different conformationally constrained cycloaliphatic diamine linkers.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Casokefamide	Casokefamide	5464104			98815-38-4				Casokefamide, also known as Î²-casomorphin 4027 (Î²-CM-4027) and [-Ala,Tyr]-Î²-casomorphin-5-amide, is a peripherally-specific, synthetic opioid pentapeptide with the amino acid sequence Tyr--Ala-Phe--Ala-Tyr-NH2. Derived from the Î²-casomorphin sequence, it was designed with the intention of improving resistance to digestive enzymes so that it could potentially be used as an antidiarrheal medicine. Unlike other casomorphins, which are generally selective Î¼-opioid receptor agonists, casokefamide binds to both the Î¼- and Î´-opioid receptors. In a clinical study, casokefamide was found to be effective via the oral route for the treatment of chronic diarrhea, and did not produce any side effects. However, further clinical development was not pursued and it was never marketed.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/JNJ-26990990	JNJ-26990990	11687376			877316-38-6				JNJ-26990990 is a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant drug currently under development by Janssen Pharmaceutica as a second-generation followup to the marketed drug topiramate. It was designed to have the same anticonvulsant effects as topirimate, but without the side effects associated with topiramate's carbonic anhydrase inhibition. It also has potential use in the treatment of inflammatory pain, neuropathic pain, and depression. JNJ-26990990 entered phase II clinical trials in October 2007. Metabolites and radioactive isotope-labeled derivatives of JNJ-26990990 have also been prepared to support its development.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-175	JWH-175	56603534			619294-35-8				JWH-175 is a drug from the naphthylmethylindole family which acts as a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It was invented by the scientist John W. Huffman and colleagues at Clemson University. JWH-175 is closely related to the widely used cannabinoid designer drug JWH-018, but with the ketone bridge replaced by a simpler methylene bridge. It is several times weaker than JWH-018, having a binding affinity at the CB1 receptor of 22nM, though some derivatives substituted at the 4-position of the naphthyl ring have potency more closely approaching that of the equivalent naphthoylindoles. This makes JWH-175 considerably less potent than most synthetic cannabinoid drugs used in synthetic cannabis blends, and it is unclear if JWH-175 has ever been used for this purpose. However it has still been explicitly banned in several jurisdictions including Russia and some Australian states, in order to stop its potential use as an ingredient in such products.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-302	JWH-302	11493740			864445-45-4				JWH-302 or (1-pentyl-3-indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist with moderate affinity at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is a positional isomer of the more common drug JWH-250, though it is slightly less potent with a Ki of 17nM at CB1, compared to 11nM for JWH-250. Because of their identical molecular weight and similar fragmentation patterns, JWH-302 and JWH-250 can be very difficult to distinguish by GC-MS testing.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quadazocine	Quadazocine	115077			69924-29-4				"Quadazocine (WIN-44,441) is an opioid antagonist of the benzomorphan family which is used in scientific research. It acts as a silent antagonist at all three of the major opioid receptorsâ€”Î¼, Îº, and Î´, but with a significant preference in affinity for the Î¼ receptor and the Îº2 subtype. As such, it has been touted as a ""Îº2-selective"" antagonist, though, of course, this is not entirely accurate on account of its similar affinity for the Î¼ receptor. As would be expected, quadazocine reverses the effects of opioid agonists like morphine and fentanyl in animals."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RU-28306	RU-28306	194528			73625-11-3				RU-28306 is a tricyclic tryptamine derivative which acts as a serotonin receptor agonist, with selectivity for 5-HT1 and 5-HT2 subtypes. It can be regarded either as a conformationally constrained derivative of DMT, or a structurally simplified analogue of LSD, but the binding affinity of racemic RU-28306 is closer to that of DMT, though with relatively higher affinity for 5-HT2 subtypes and lower for 5-HT1.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/S-Ethylisothiouronium_diethylphosphate	S-Ethylisothiouronium diethylphosphate	11847634			21704-46-1				S-Ethylisothiouronium diethylphosphate (brand name Difetur) is an S-alkylisothiouronium derivative used as an antihypotensive drug. The S-alkylisothiouronium compounds are used in processes of treating acute hypotension, which may result, for example, from shock or hemorrhage, and in processes for treating hyperoxic conditions, for example, oxygen poisoning.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/OSU-6162	OSU-6162	9795741			156907-84-5				OSU-6162 (PNU-96391) is a compound which acts as a partial agonist at both dopamine D2 receptors and 5-HT2A receptors. It acts as a dopamine stabilizer in a similar manner to the closely related drug pridopidine, and has antipsychotic, anti-addictive and anti-Parkinsonian effects in animal studies. Both enantiomers show similar activity but with different ratios of effects, with the (S) enantiomer (â€“)-OSU-6162 that is more commonly used in research, having higher binding affinity to D2 but is a weaker partial agonist at 5-HT2A, while the (R) enantiomer (+)-OSU-6162 has higher efficacy at 5-HT2A but lower D2 affinity.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5,N,N-TMT	5,N,N-TMT	1837			22120-39-4				5,N,N-trimethyltryptamine (5,N,N-TMT; 5-TMT) is a tryptamine derivative that is a hallucinogenic drug. It was first made in 1958 by E. H. Young. In animal experiments it was found to be in between DMT and 5-MeO-DMT in potency which would suggest an active dosage for humans in the 20â€“60Â mg range. Human psychoactivity for this compound has been claimed in reports on websites such as Erowid but has not been independently confirmed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artelinic_acid	Artelinic acid	180423			120020-26-0				Artelinic acid (or its salt, artelinate) is an experimental drug that is being investigated as a treatment for malaria. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of the natural compound artemisinin. Artelinic acid has a lower rate of neurotoxicity than the related artemisin derivatives arteether and artemether, but is three times more toxic than artesunate. At present, artelinic acid seems unlikely to enter routine clinical use, because it offers no clear benefits over the artemesinins already available (artesunate and artemether). Artelinic acid has not yet been evaluated for use in humans.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ascomycin	Ascomycin	5282071			11011-38-4				Ascomycin, also called Immunomycin, FR-900520, FK520, is an ethyl analog of tacrolimus (FK506) with strong immunosuppressant properties. It can be used to treat autoimmune diseases and skin diseases, and can help prevent rejection after an organ transplant. Ascomycin acts by binding to immunophilins, especially macrophilin-12. It appears that Ascomycin inhibits the production of Th1 (interferon- and IL-2) and Th2 (IL-4 and IL-10) cytokines. Additionally, ascomycin preferentially inhibits the activation of mast cells, an important cellular component of the atopic response. Ascomycin produces a more selective immunomodulatory effect in that it inhibits the elicitation phase of allergic contact dermatitis but does not impair the primary immune response when administered systemically. Ascomycin is produced by the fermentation of Streptomyces hygroscopicus.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Betahydroxythiofentanyl	Betahydroxythiofentanyl	62278			1474-34-6				Betahydroxythiofentanyl Î²-hydroxythiofentanyl is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of fentanyl. Î²-hydroxythiofentanyl was sold briefly on the black market in the early 1980s, before the introduction of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared. Î²-hydroxythiofentanyl was anecdotally said to be one of the more favored fentanyl analogues by opiate addicts, but nevertheless its brief career as a street drug did not survive the introduction of the Analogues Act. Î²-hydroxythiofentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea, and respiratory depression, which can be serious and even life-threatening.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Boromycin	Boromycin	6436027			34524-20-4				Boromycin is a bacteriocidal polyether-macrolide antibiotic. It was initially isolated from the Streptomyces strain Streptomyces antibioticus, and is notable for being the first natural product found to contain the element boron. It is effective against most Gram-positive bacteria, but is ineffective against Gram-negative bacteria. Boromycin kills bacteria by negatively affecting the cytoplasmic membrane, resulting in the loss of potassium ions from the cell.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ciproxifan	Ciproxifan	6422124			184025-19-2				Ciproxifan is an extremely potent histamine H3 inverse agonist/antagonist. The histamine H3 receptor is an inhibitory autoreceptor located on histaminergic nerve terminals, and is believed to be involved in modulating the release of histamine in the brain. Histamine has an excitatory effect in the brain via H1 receptors in the cerebral cortex, and so drugs such as ciproxifan which block the H3 receptor and consequently allow more histamine to be released have an alertness-promoting effect. Ciproxifan produces wakefulness and attentiveness in animal studies, and produced cognitive enhancing effects without prominent stimulant effects at relatively low levels of receptor occupancy, and pronounced wakefulness at higher doses. It has therefore been proposed as a potential treatment for sleep disorders such as narcolepsy and to improve vigilance in old age, particularly in the treatment of conditions such as Alzheimer's disease. It also potentiated the effects of antipsychotic drugs, and has been suggested as an adjuvant treatment for schizophrenia.

Neither its fat-burning effects in humans nor any potential side effects have been empirically established. Evodiamine acts primarily as a thermogenic and stimulant.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Technetium_(99mTc)_tetrofosmin	Technetium (99mTc) tetrofosmin				127455-27-0		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		Technetium (Tc) tetrofosmin is a drug used in nuclear medicine cardiac imaging. It is sold under the brand name Myoview. The radioisotope, technetium-99m, is chelated by two 1,2-bis[di-(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino di-(2-ethoxyethyl)phosphino]ethane ligands which belong to the group of diphosphines and which are referred to as tetrofosmin. Tc-99m tetrofosmin is rapidly taken up by myocardial tissue and reaches its maximum level in approximately 5 minutes. About 66% of the total injected dose is excreted within 48 hours after injection (40% urine, 26% feces). Tc-99m tetrofosmin is indicated for use in scintigraphic imaging of the myocardium under stress and rest conditions. It is used to determine areas of reversible ischemia and infarcted tissue in the heart. It is also indicated to detect changes in perfusion induced by pharmacologic stress in patients with coronary artery disease. Its third indication is to assess left ventricular function (ejection fraction) in patients thought to have heart disease. No contraindications are known for use of Tc-99m tetrofosmin, but care should be taken to constantly monitor the cardiac function in patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease. Patients should be encouraged to void their bladders as soon as the images are gathered, and as often as possible after the tests to decrease their radiation doses, since the majority of elimination is renal. The recommended dose of Tc-99m tetrofosmin is between 5 and 33 millicuries (185-1221 megabecquerels). For a two-dose stress/rest dosing, the typical dose is normally a 10 mCi dose, followed one to four hours later by a dose of 30 mCi. Imaging normally begins 15 minutes following injection.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/3-Hydroxymorphinan	3-Hydroxymorphinan				1531-12-0				3-Hydroxymorphinan (3-HM), or morphinan-3-ol, is a psychoactive drug of the morphinan family. It is the racemic version of norlevorphanol. The dextrorotatory stereoisomer of the compound is an active metabolite of dextromethorphan, dextrorphan, and 3-methoxymorphinan, and similarly to them has potent neuroprotective and neurotrophic effects on LTS- and MPTP-treated dopaminergic neurons of the nigrostriatal pathway, but notably without producing any neuropsychotoxic side effects or having any anticonvulsant actions. It does not seem to bind to the NMDA receptor, and instead, its neuroprotective properties appear result from inhibition of glutamate release via the suppression of presynaptic voltage-dependent Ca entry and protein kinase C activity. In any case, as such, the compound has been investigated as a potential antiparkinsonian agent. A prodrug, GCC1290K, has been developed on account of 3-HM's poor bioavailability (18%), and a New Drug Application has been approved for it by the United States Food and Drug Administration. It is currently undergoing clinical trials for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. 3-HM's levorotatory stereoisomer, norlevorphanol, in contrast to (+)-3-HM, is an opioid analgesic. It was never marketed as such however, probably due to a combination of the facts that norlevorphanol has low bioavailability and that its potency is diminished compared to its N-methylated analogue levorphanol.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/2,N,N-TMT	2,N,N-TMT				1080-95-1				2,N,N-Trimethyltryptamine, 2,N,N-TMT, or 2-Me-DMT is a tryptamine derivative that is a hallucinogenic drug. It was invented by Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book TiHKAL (#34). It is claimed to show psychoactive effects at a dosage of 50â€“100Â mg orally, but these are relatively mild compared to other similar drugs, suggesting that while the 2-methyl group has blocked the binding of metabolic enzymes, it is also interfering with binding to the 5HT2A receptor target that mediates the hallucinogenic effects of these drugs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Hydroxy-5-methoxydimethyltryptamine	4-Hydroxy-5-methoxydimethyltryptamine				2433-31-0				4-Hydroxy-5-methoxydimethyltryptamine, or 4-HO-5-MeO-DMT is the 4-hydroxy counterpart of 5-MeO-DMT, or the 5-methoxy counterpart of psilocin. It is a psychedelic tryptamine but very little is known about it. The only report of it in the chemical literature was a paper published by Marc Julia's group at the Pasteur Institute in 1965. They only reported the synthesis and physical properties of the compound and it has never been documented or explored in any other way. Their paper cites a 10 step synthesis of 4-HO-5-MeO-DMT from ortho-vanillin. However, Alexander Shulgin has explained that it could be possible to cultivate 4-HO-5-MeO-DMT in psilocybin mushrooms by adding 5-MeO-DMT to the growing substrate of the fungus. Though this method has never been explored with 5-MeO-DMT, it has been used successfully for changing DET into 4-HO-DET and 4-PO-DET, both of which had never before been found in nature. In the case of DET the mushrooms yielded only 4-HO-DET or 4-PO-DET respectively, instead of psilocin (4-HO-DMT) and psilocybin (4-PO-DMT), suggesting that the presence of the extraneous N-dialkylated tryptamines competed for the enzymes in the fungus mycelium that would normally produce psilocin. This method thus not only produced new chemical compounds that had never previously been made synthetically, but also rendered the fungus itself completely legal in many countries because of its absence of psilocin or psilocybin, although in countries with stricter drug analogue laws such as the USA or Australia the novel tryptamines produced might also be considered illegal. Theoretically, this method would 4-hydroxylate and 4-phosphoryloxylate any tryptamine added to the substrate, opening the possibility of synthesizing as yet undiscovered tryptamines.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/DHA-clozapine	DHA-clozapine				225916-82-5				DHA-clozapine (trade name Clozaprexin) is an atypical antipsychotic that has been developed by Protarga. The drug has been created by the association of the fatty acid docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) with clozapine. The advantages of this drug are that until the DHA and clozapine are separated, the drug is inactive; once it penetrates the blood brain barrier, the DHA and clozapine are freed from each other slowly by enzymatic activity and therefore more clozapine is liberated where it is needed, rendering the drug much more potent, actively longer in duration, and therefore requiring a much lower dosage, which results in fewer side effects. The drug is not yet available.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ro64-6198	Ro64-6198	9844019							Ro64-6198 is an nociceptoid drug used in scientific research. It acts as a potent and selective agonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 (opiate receptor like-1) receptor, with over 100x selectivity over other opioid receptors. It produces anxiolytic effects in animal studies equivalent to those of benzodiazepine drugs, but has no anticonvulsant effects and does not produce any overt effects on behaviour. However it does impair short-term memory, and counteracts stress-induced anorexia. It also has antitussive effects, and reduces the rewarding and analgesic effects of morphine, although it did not prevent the development of dependence. It has been shown to reduce alcohol self-administration in animals and suppressed relapses in animal models of alcoholism, and ORL-1 agonists may have application in the treatment of alcoholism. Ro64-6198 was able to be recognised as a discriminative stimulus by rats distinct from other opioid receptor ligands, but was not able to produce the conditioned place preference thought to be indicative of addictive potential. Consequently while the role of ORL-1 receptors in the body is complex and remains poorly understood, Ro64-6198 has demonstrated multiple pharmacological actions and has been very useful in the study of the ORL-1 receptor system, especially in relation to anxiety and anorexia; however, due to poor oral bioavailability, Ro 64-6198 will most likely not be pursued clinically. Studies in primates showed it to have analgesic effects but without producing respiratory depression or reinforcing effects.

It has moderate affinity for CB2 receptors with a Ki of 11nM, but 22x lower affinity for the psychoactive CB1 receptors with a Ki of 245nM. The indole 2-methyl derivative has the ratio of affinities reversed however, with a Ki of 8nM at CB1 and 29nM at CB2, which contrasts with the usual trend of 2-methyl derivatives having increased selectivity for CB2. Chemically, it is closely related to another indole-3-carboxamide synthetic cannabinoid, Org 28611, but with a different cycloalkyl substitution on the carboxamide, and the cyclohexylmethyl group replaced by morpholinylethyl, as in JWH-200 or A-796,260. Early compounds such as these have subsequently led to the development of a large number of related indole-3-carboxamide cannabinoid ligands.

Acamprosate is thought to stabilize the chemical balance in the brain that would otherwise be disrupted by alcoholism, possibly by antagonizing glutamatergic N-methyl--aspartate receptors and agonizing gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) type A receptors. Reports indicate that acamprosate only works with a combination of attending support groups and abstinence from alcohol. Certain serious side effects include diarrhea, allergic reactions, irregular heartbeats, and low or high blood pressure, while less serious side effects include headaches, insomnia, and impotence. Acamprosate should not be taken by people with kidney problems or allergies to the drug. Campral is manufactured and marketed in the United States by Forest Laboratories, while Merck KGaA markets it outside the US.

First synthesized on December 11, 1950, chlorpromazine was the first drug developed with specific antipsychotic action, and would serve as the prototype for the phenothiazine class of drugs, which later grew to comprise several other agents. The introduction of chlorpromazine into clinical use has been described as the single greatest advance in psychiatric care, dramatically improving the prognosis of patients in psychiatric hospitals worldwide. The availability of antipsychotic drugs curtailed indiscriminate use of electroconvulsive therapy and psychosurgery, and was one of the driving forces behind the deinstitutionalization movement. Chlorpromazine works on a variety of receptors in the central nervous system, producing anticholinergic, antidopaminergic, antihistaminic, and weak antiadrenergic effects. Both the clinical indications and side effect profile of CPZ are determined by this broad action: its anticholinergic properties cause constipation, sedation, and hypotension, and help relieve nausea. It also has anxiolytic (anxiety-relieving) properties. Its antidopaminergic properties can cause extrapyramidal symptoms such as akathisia (restlessness, aka the 'Thorazine shuffle' where the patient walks almost constantly, despite having nowhere to go due to mandatory confinement, and takes small, shuffling steps) and dystonia. It is known to cause tardive dyskinesia, which can be irreversible. In recent years, chlorpromazine has been largely superseded by the newer atypical antipsychotics, which are usually better tolerated, and its use is now restricted to fewer indications. In acute settings, it is often administered as a syrup, which has a faster onset of action than tablets, and can also be given by intramuscular injection. IV administration is very irritating and is not advised; its use is limited to severe hiccups, surgery, and tetanus.

It is a strong agonist at the Î¼-opioid receptors. Historically it has been used to treat breakthrough pain and is commonly used in pre-procedures as a pain reliever as well as an anesthetic in combination with a benzodiazepine. Fentanyl is approximately 80 times more potent than morphine, with 100Â micrograms of fentanyl approximately equivalent to 10Â mg of morphine and 75Â mg of pethidine (meperidine) in analgesic activity. It has an LD50 of 3.1Â milligrams per kilogram in rats, and an LD50 of 0.03Â milligrams per kilogram in monkeys. Fentanyl was first synthesized by Paul Janssen in 1960 following the medical inception of pethidine several years earlier. Janssen developed fentanyl by assaying analogues of the structurally related drug pethidine for opioid activity. The widespread use of fentanyl triggered the production of fentanyl citrate, which entered the clinical practice as a general anaesthetic under the trade name Sublimaze in the 1960s. Following this, many other fentanyl analogues were developed and introduced into medical practice, including sufentanil, alfentanil, remifentanil, and lofentanil. In the mid-1990s, fentanyl was first introduced for widespread palliative use with the clinical introduction of the Duragesic patch, followed in the next decade by the introduction of the first quick-acting prescription formations of fentanyl for personal use, the Actiq lollipop and Fentora buccal tablets. Through the delivery method of transdermal patches, as of 2012 fentanyl was the most widely used synthetic opioid in clinical practice, with several new delivery methods currently in development, including a sublingual spray for cancer patients. Fentanyl and derivatives have been used as recreational drugs; as such they have caused fatalities.

It is one of the few hydrazine MAOIs still in clinical use, along with phenelzine. Isocarboxazid is used to combat numerous medical problems, such as: depression, social anxiety, and panic disorder;it is in the process of becoming a medication to aid in the fight against Parkinsonâ€™s and other dementia-related disorders. Although medicinally helpful to people in need, isocarboxazid has many side effects, including headaches, jaundice, chest pain, rapid swelling and weight gain, fainting, dizziness and tremors. Isocarboxazid is from a class of medications called monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). MAOIs, isocarboxazid included, increase the levels of biogenic amine neurotransmitters found within the brain and also increase the availability of these neurotransmitters. Isocarboxazid is not used as frequently as other medications for depression and anxiety because it is extremely powerful and also reacts to certain foods, such as tyramine, because it inhibits the catabolism of dietary amines found within everyday foods [2 2]. Isocarboxazid and other MAOIs are often looked at as a â€œlast resortâ€ﾝ medication due to their reactions to foods and powerful contents. It has been used off-label to treat depersonalization disorder.

Isotretinoin's best-known and most dangerous side effect is birth defects due to in utero exposure. This is because of the molecule's close resemblance to retinoic acid, a natural vitamin A derivative which controls normal embryonic development. In the United States a special procedure is required to obtain the pharmaceutical. In 2009, Roche decided to pull Accutane off the US market after juries had awarded millions of dollars in damages to former Accutane users over inflammatory bowel disease claims. Among others, actor James Marshall sued Roche over Accutane-related disease that resulted in removal of his colon. The most common brands are Roaccutane (Hoffman-La Roche, known as Accutane in the United States before July 2009), Amnesteem, Claravis, Isotroin or Sotret.

Lindane is a neurotoxin that interferes with GABA neurotransmitter function by interacting with the GABAA receptor-chloride channel complex at the picrotoxin binding site. In humans, lindane affects the nervous system, liver and kidneys, and may be a carcinogen. It is unclear whether lindane is an endocrine disruptor. The World Health Organization classifies lindane as ""Moderately Hazardous,"" and its international trade is restricted and regulated under the Rotterdam Convention on Prior Informed Consent. In 2009, the production and agricultural use of lindane was banned under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants. A specific exemption to that ban allows it to continue to be used as a second-line pharmaceutical treatment for lice and scabies."

However, Maprotiline's fourth ring is spurious, as formed by a bridge across the central tricyclic ring. It is a strong norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with only weak effects on serotonin and dopamine reuptake. It exerts blocking effects at the following postsynaptic receptors: StrongÂ : H1 ModerateÂ : 5-HT2, alpha1 WeakÂ : D2, mACh The pharmacologic profile of Maprotiline explains its antidepressant, sedative, anxiolytic, and sympathomimetic activities. Additionally, it shows a strong antagonism against Reserpine-induced effects in animal studies, as do the other 'classical' antidepressants. Although Maprotiline behaves in most regards as a 'first generation antidepressant' it is commonly referred to as 'second generation antidepressant'. Sedation has a fast onset (the same day), while remission of the depression itself is noted usually after a latent period of one to four weeks. Maprotiline does not improve mood in nondepressed persons.

Pefloxacin is commonly referred to as a fluoroquinolone drug and is a member of the fluoroquinolone class of antibacterials. It is an analog of norfloxacin. It is a synthetic fluoroquinolone, belonging to the 3rd generation of quinolones. Pefloxacin is extensively prescribed in France. Pefloxacin has not been approved for use in the United States. There are no licensed uses for Pefloxacin in the United States, as the FDA has not approved this drug. The licensed use varies in other countries and is quite limited as Pefloxacin is to be considered a drug of last resort when all other antibiotics have failed. There appears to be eight common uses in the adult population and no approved uses in the pediatric population, as well as a variety of veterinary uses (as documented within the package inserts). Pefloxacin interacts with a number of other drugs, a number of herbal and natural supplements, and certain thyroid medications.

It is no longer sold in the United States. Quick look at the Pharmacokinetics Tocainide is a lidocaine analog, that does not have significant 1st pass metabolism. It is found in two enantiomers. The R isomer is 4x as potent as the S. Oral bioavailability is 0.9-1.0. In the blood tocainide is 10-20% protein bound. The Volume of distribution is 2.5-3.5 L/kg. 30-50% is excreted unchanged in the urine. The more active R-isomer is cleared faster in anephric patients or those with severe renal dysfunction. The main metabolite is the glucuronidated tocainide carbamic acid. The glucuronosyl transferase is apparently induced by rifampin. Weak inhibition of Cyp1A2 leads to a mild theophylline interaction.

It was first used in humans in the 1950s, but is now little used in humans (the closely related analogue, chlorpromazine, is still used as an antipsychotic in humans). Acepromazine is frequently used in animals as a sedative and antiemetic. Its principal value is in quietening and calming anxious animals. The standard pharmaceutical preparation, acepromazine maleate, is used in veterinary medicine in dogs, and cats. It is used widely in horses as a pre-anaesthetic sedative and has been shown to reduce anaesthesia related death. However, is contraindicated in stallions due to the risk of paraphimosis and persistent priapism. Its potential for cardiac effects, namely hypotension due to peripheral vasodilation, can be profound and as such is not recommended for use in geriatric or debilitated animals, especially dogs. In these cases it is most often substituted with midazolam or diazepam and left out of the preanesthetic medication altogether.

Aminophylline is a nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist and phosphodiesterase inhibitor capable of reversing ischemia-induced bradyasystole. It does this by improving the rate of return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC). During atropine-resistant out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, all aspects of attempted resuscitation must proceed in accordance with standard Advanced Cardiac Life Support (ACLS) guidelines. After exhaustive conventional therapy, aminophylline is administered early in resuscitation efforts to re-establish cardiac rhythm. With aminophylline administration, the patient may have immediate resumption of cardiac electrical activity. Aminophylline should be an intervention with the ACLS treatment of atropine-resistant asystolic out-of-hospital cardiac arrest.

The chemical names for barbitone are diethylmalonyl urea or diethylbarbituric acid; hence, the sodium salt (known as medinal, a genericised trademark in the United Kingdom), is known also as sodium diethylbarbiturate. Barbitone was prepared by condensing diethylmalonic ester with urea in the presence of sodium ethoxide, and then by adding at least two molar equivalents of ethyl iodide to the silver salt of malonylurea or possibly to a basic solution of the acid. The result was an odorless, slightly bitter, white crystalline powder.

Cefixime is a cephalosporin antibiotic used to treat infections caused by bacteria. These include infections of the: Ear (otitis media caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis,and S. pyogenes. ) Nose, sinuses (sinusitis), Throat (tonsillitis, pharyngitis caused by S. pyogenes), Chest and lungs (bronchitis, pneumonia caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae) and Urinary system and Uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae. The bactericidal action of cephalosporin due to the inhibition of cell wall synthesis. It binds to one of the penicillin binding proteins (PBPs) which inhibits the final transpeptidation step of the peptidoglycan synthesis in the bacterial cell wall, thus inhibiting biosynthesis and arresting cell wall assembly resulting in bacterial cell death. Absorption Only 40-50% is absorbed from the GI tract (oral); rate may be decreased if taken with food. Greater absorption from oral suspensions than tablet. Distribution It has high concentrations in bile and urine. It can cross the placenta ad its protein binding capacity is 65%. It is always better to perform appropriate cultures and susceptibility studies to determine the causative organism and its sensitivity to cefixime. Cefixime is contraindicated in patients with known sensitivity or allergies to cephalosporin class of antibiotics. As Cefixime is a third generation cephalosporin, it is not contraindicated for patients with a true penicillin allergy. Adverse Drug Reactions include diarrhea, dyspepsia, nausea, vomiting. Hypersensitivity reactions like skin rashes, urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome have been reported. There is no specific antidote for cefixime overdosage. Gastric lavage may performed. Dialysis will not remove cefixime in significant quantities. It was sold under the trade name Suprax in the USA until 2003 when it was taken off the market by drug manufacturer Wyeth after its patent expired.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chlortalidone	Chlortalidone	2732	DB00310	Q0MQD1073Q	77-36-1		Oral		Chlortalidone or chlorthalidone is a diuretic drug used to treat hypertension, originally marketed as Hygroton in the USA. It is described as a thiazide diuretic (or, rather, a thiazide-like diuretic because it acts similarly to the thiazides but does not contain the benzothiadiazine molecular structure). Compared with other medications of the thiazide class, chlortalidone has the longest duration of action but a similar diuretic effect at maximal therapeutic doses. It is often used in the management of hypertension and edema. Unlike loop diuretics, chlortalidone efficacy is diminished in patients with certain renal diseases (e.g. chronic renal disease). A clinical trial (ALLHAT) in 2002 compared chlortalidone to doxazosin in the treatment of high-risk hypertensive patients. In this study, only chlortalidone significantly reduced the risk of combined cardiovascular disease events, especially heart failure, when compared with drugs such as doxazosin. Chlortalidone was approved by the FDA in 1960. The ALLHAT study conclusions showed that there was no significant difference in all-cause mortality, fatal heart disease, or non-fatal myocardial infarction when chlortalidone was compared with lisinopril or amlodipine but did show decrease rates of heart failure after 6 years when compared with amlodipine and decreased rates of cerebrovascular disease after 6 years when compared with lisinopril leading the study conclusions to say that thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-step in antihypertensive therapy.

This meant that it has never been adopted for medical use as an anaesthetic as it is far too dangerous for this purpose, but instead is used for euthanasia in veterinary medicine, mainly for euthanising dogs. It is formulated as a combination product under the brand name Tributame, which also contains chloroquine and lidocaine. Embutramide is used for euthanasia of a range of different animals, mainly small animals kept as pets rather than large farm animals. It may cause significant pain to the animal being euthanised, and so may be less humane than older drugs used for this purpose such as pentobarbital, however it may have less abuse potential than barbiturates especially in the Tributame combination formulation, and so is less likely to be diverted for recreational abuse. Embutramide has however been reported to be used for suicide by people with access to the drug, and was added to the list of Schedule III drugs in the USA in 2006.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penbutolol	Penbutolol	37464	DB01359	78W62V43DY	36507-48-9				Penbutolol (Levatol, Levatolol, Lobeta, Paginol, Hostabloc, Betapressin) is a medication in the class of beta blockers, used in the treatment of high blood pressure. Penbutolol is able to bind to both beta-1 adrenergic receptors and beta-2 adrenergic receptors (the two subtypes), thus making it a non-selective Î² blocker [1 1]. Penbutolol is a sympathomimetic drug with properties allowing it to act as a partial agonist at Î² adrenergic receptors [2 2]. Penbutolol has also been found to be one of very few compounds that are 5-HT1A antagonists. 5-HT1A receptors are activated by serotonin, which have many different actions in different species. This makes it difficult to create generalizations about serotonin and its effects [1 1].

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Voglibose	Voglibose	444020	DB04878	S77P977AG8	83480-29-9				Voglibose (INN and USAN, trade name Voglib, marketed by Mascot Health Series) is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor used for lowering post-prandial blood glucose levels in people with diabetes mellitus. Voglibose delays the absorption of glucose thereby reduces the risk of macrovascular complications. Voglibose is a research product of Takeda Pharma, a Japan based company. Postprandial hyperglycemia (PPHG) is primarily due to first phase insulin secretion. Alpha glucosidase inhibitors delay glucose absorption at the intestine level and thereby prevent sudden surge of glucose after a meal. There are three drugs which belong to this class, acarbose, miglitol and voglibose, of which voglibose is the newest. Voglibose scores over both acarbose and miglitol in terms of side effect profile. But acarbose has an edge over voglibose in terms of efficacy. There are several trials supporting the use of voglibose in the management of PPHG. Also, it has been established that it is PPHG, not FPG, which is the marker of cardiovascular disorders associated with diabetes. So, controlling PPHG is imperative and voglibose is indicated for the management of PPHG.

Amodiaquine has been shown to be more effective than chloroquine in treating chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum malaria infections and may afford more protection than chloroquine when used as weekly prophylaxis. Amodiaquine, like chloroquine, is generally well tolerated. Although licensed, this drug is not marketed in the United States, but is widely available in Africa. Its use, therefore, is probably more practicable in long-term visitors and persons who will reside in Africa. Amodiaquine is a histamine N-methyltransferase inhibitor.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Camptothecin	Camptothecin	2538	DB04690	XT3Z54Z28A	7689-03-4				Camptothecin (CPT) is a cytotoxic quinoline alkaloid which inhibits the DNA enzyme topoisomerase I (topo I). It was discovered in 1966 by M. E. Wall and M. C. Wani in systematic screening of natural products for anticancer drugs. It was isolated from the bark and stem of Camptotheca acuminata (Camptotheca, Happy tree), a tree native to China used as a cancer treatment in Traditional Chinese Medicine. CPT showed remarkable anticancer activity in preliminary clinical trials but also low solubility and (high) adverse drug reaction. Because of these disadvantages synthetic and medicinal chemists have developed numerous syntheses of Camptothecin and various derivatives to increase the benefits of the chemical, with good results. Two CPT analogues have been approved and are used in cancer chemotherapy today, topotecan and irinotecan.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Estrone	Estrone	5870	DB00655	2DI9HA706A	53-16-7				Estrone (E1, and also oestrone) is an estrogenic hormone secreted by the ovary as well as adipose tissue with the chemical name of 3-hydroxyestra-1,3,5(10)-triene-17-one and athechemical formula C18H22O2. Estrone is an odorless, solid crystalline powder, white in color with a melting point of 254.5 Â°C and a specific gravity of 1.23. Estrone is one of several natural estrogens, which also include estriol and estradiol. Estrone is the least abundant of the three hormones; estradiol is present almost always in the reproductive female body, and estriol is abundant primarily during pregnancy. Estrone is known to be a carcinogen for human females as well as cause breast tenderness or pain, nausea, headache, hypertension, and leg cramps. In men, estrone has been known to cause anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and erectile disfunction. Estrone is relevant to health and disease states because of its conversion to estrone sulfate, a long-lived derivative. Estrone sulfate acts as a reservoir that can be converted as needed to the more active estradiol. It is the predominant estrogen in postmenopausal women. Estrone can be released into the environment through waste streams.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethionamide	Ethionamide	2761171	DB00609	OAY8ORS3CQ	536-33-4				Ethionamide (2-ethylthioisonicotinamide, Trecator SC) is an antibiotic used in the treatment of tuberculosis. It was discovered in 1956. Ethionamide works to induce expression of EthA, a NAD derivative which is toxic to the bacteria. The resistance mechanism of this drug is through EthR, resistance is common. Therefore, EthR inhibitors are of great interest. It is a prodrug and as a thioamide, it is used in regimens to treat multi-drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis. It has been proposed for use in combination with gatifloxacin. The action may be through disruption of mycolic acid.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Guanethidine	Guanethidine	3518	DB01170	5UBY8Y002G	645-43-2				Guanethidine is an antihypertensive drug that reduces the release of catecholamines, such as norepinephrine. Guanethidine is transported across the sympathetic nerve membrane by the same mechanism that transports norepinephrine itself (NET, uptake 1), and uptake is essential for the drug's action. Once guanethidine has entered the nerve, it is concentrated in transmitter vesicles, where it replaces norepinephrine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hexachlorophene	Hexachlorophene	3598	DB00756	IWW5FV6NK2	70-30-4				Hexachlorophene, also known as Nabac, is a disinfectant. The compound occurs as a white to light-tan crystalline powder, which either is odorless or produces a slightly phenolic odor. In medicine, hexachlorophene is very useful as a topical anti-infective, anti-bacterial agent, often used in soaps and toothpaste. It is also used in agriculture as a soil fungicide, plant bactericide, and acaricide. Hexachlorophene products can be lethal from percutaneous (through the skin) absorption. Children may be specifically susceptible. Hexachlorophene (6.3%) was added to â€œbaby powderâ€ﾝ in France due to a manufacturing error. It, or possibly contaminating dioxins, caused encephalopathy and ulcerative skin lesions. 36 of 204 exposed children died within a few days of exposure. Two companies manufactured over-the-counter preparations. One, by The Mennen Company, Morristown, NJ, was Baby Magic Bath. Mennen recalled the product, and it was removed from retail distribution. Right after the withdrawal, there was an outbreak of Staphylococcus infections in hospitals across the USA. A commercial preparation of the drug, pHisoHex, was widely used as an effective antibacterial skin cleanser in the treatment of acne. In the US during the 1960s, it was available over the counter, and remains available as a prescription body wash. In the E.U. during the 1970s and 1980s, it was available over the counter. A related product, pHisoAc, was used as a skin mask to dry and peel away acne lesions. Another preparation, pHiso-Scrub, was a hexachlorophene-impregnated sponge for scrubbing; it has since been discontinued. In 1969, hexachlorophene became suspected of causing cancer, and studies determined that oral ingestion of hexachlorophene led to weakness and paralysis in laboratory rats. In 1972 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration outlawed its use in non-medicinal products like Dial soap. In 1973, after studies found relatively high concentrations of hexachlorophene in the blood of neonates washed with a 3% solution it was withdrawn from over-the-counter sales, though still available by prescription. A 1978 study undertaken by the U.S. National Institutes of Health indicated that hexachlorophene does not cause cancer. However, the MSDS still lists this compound as an experimental teratogen. Possibly because of the previous questions concerning its effects, most dermatologists today do not prescribe it for acne treatment. Several substitute products were developed, but none had the germ-killing capability of hexachlorophene.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cholestyramine	Cholestyramine		DB01432	4B33BGI082	11041-12-6		gastrointestinal	bile acids	Cholestyramine or colestyramine (Questran, Questran Light, Cholybar) is a bile acid sequestrant, which binds bile in the gastrointestinal tract to prevent its reabsorption. It is a strong ion exchange resin, which means that it can exchange its chloride anions with anionic bile acids in the gastrointestinal tract and bind them strongly in the resin matrix. The functional group of the anion exchange resin is a quaternary ammonium group attached to an inert styrene-divinylbenzene copolymer. Cholestyramine removes bile acids from the body by forming insoluble complexes with bile acids in the intestine, which are then excreted in the feces. When bile acids are excreted, plasma cholesterol is converted to bile acid to normalize bile acid levels. This conversion of cholesterol into bile acids lowers plasma cholesterol concentrations.

It consists of microcrystals that slowly release insulin, giving a long duration of action of 18 to 26 hours, with a ""peakless"" profile (according to the Lantus package insert). Pharmacokinetically, it resembles basal insulin secretion of non-diabetic pancreatic beta cells. Sometimes, in type 2 diabetes and in combination with a short acting sulfonylurea (drugs which stimulate the pancreas to make more insulin), it can offer moderate control of serum glucose levels. In the absence of endogenous insulinâ€”type 1 diabetes, depleted type 2 (in some cases) or latent autoimmune diabetes of adults in late stageâ€”Lantus needs the support of fast acting insulin taken with food to reduce the effect of prandially derived glucose."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nalmefene	Nalmefene	5284594		TOV02TDP9I	55096-26-9		Oral, Intravenous	hepatic	"Nalmefene (Revex), originally known as nalmetrene, is an opioid receptor antagonist developed in the early 1970s, and used primarily in the management of alcohol dependence, and also has been investigated for the treatment of other addictions such as pathological gambling and addiction to shopping. Nalmefene is an opiate derivative similar in both structure and activity to the opiate antagonist naltrexone. Advantages of nalmefene relative to naltrexone include longer half-life, greater oral bioavailability and no observed dose-dependent liver toxicity. As with other drugs of this type, nalmefene can precipitate acute withdrawal symptoms in patients who are dependent on opioid drugs, or more rarely when used post-operatively to counteract the effects of strong opioids used in surgery. Nalmefene differs from naltrexone by substitution of the ketone group at the 6-position of naltrexone with a methylene group (CH2), which considerably increases binding affinity to the Î¼-opioid receptor. Nalmefene also has high affinity for the other opioid receptors, and is known as a ""universal antagonist"" for its ability to block all three. In clinical trials using this drug, doses used for treating alcoholism were in the range of 20â€“80Â mg per day, orally. The doses tested for treating pathological gambling were between 25â€“100Â mg per day. In both trials, there was little difference in efficacy between the lower and higher dosage regimes, and the lower dose (20 and 25Â mg, respectively) was the best tolerated, with similar therapeutic efficacy to the higher doses and less side effects. Nalmefene is thus around twice as potent as naltrexone when used for the treatment of addictions. Intravenous doses of nalmefene at between 0.5 to 1 milligram have been shown effective at counteracting the respiratory depression produced by opiate overdose, although this is not the usual application for this drug as naloxone is less expensive. Doses of nalmefene greater than 1.5Â mg do not appear to give any greater benefit in this application. Nalmefene's longer half-life might however make it useful for treating overdose involving longer acting opioids such as methadone, as it would require less frequent dosing and hence reduce the likelihood of renarcotization as the antagonist wears off. Nalmefene is extensively metabolised in the liver, mainly by conjugation with glucuronic acid and also by N-dealkylation. Less than 5% of the dose is excreted unchanged. The glucuronide metabolite is entirely inactive, while the N-dealkylated metabolite has minimal pharmacological activity. Lundbeck has licensed the drug from Biotie Therapies and performed clinical trials with nalmefene for treatment of alcohol-dependence. In 2011 they submitted an application for their drug termed Selincro to the European Medicines Agency. It has not been available on the US market since at least August 2008."

Marketed as its hydrochloride as Operidine or Lealgin, is an opioid used as a general anesthetic. It is a derivative of isonipecotic acid, like pethidine, and is metabolized in part to norpethidine. It is 20-200 times as potent as pethidine as an analgesic. In humans 1 milligram is equipotent with 10Â mg morphine. It has less effect on the circulatory system and is less hypnotic than morphine, but it has about the same emetic effect. The nausea can be prevented by giving droperidol or haloperidol. After an intravenous dose the analgesia sets in after 3â€“5 minutes. Phenoperidine shares structural similarities with both pethidine and haloperidol. While not commonly used today in clinical practice, it is of historical interest as a precursor in the development of some of the most widely used neuroleptic drugs on the market today.

Chemically, levocetirizine is the active enantiomer of cetirizine. It is the R-enantiomer of the cetirizine racemate. Levocetirizine works by blocking histamine receptors. It does not prevent the actual release of histamine from mast cells, but prevents it binding to its receptors. This in turn prevents the release of other allergy chemicals and increased blood supply to the area, and provides relief from the typical symptoms of hay fever. The manufacturers claim it to be more effective with fewer side effects than the second-generation drugs; however, there have been no published studies supporting this assertion, although other studies have concluded it may be more effective.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicorandil	Nicorandil	47528		260456HAM0	65141-46-0			http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Nicorandil is a vasodilatory drug used to treat angina. It is marketed under the trade names Ikorel (in the United Kingdom, Australia and most of Europe), Angedil, Dancor, Nikoran,PCA, Aprior, Nitorubin, and Sigmart. Nicorandil is not available in the United States. Angina is chest pain that results from episodes of transient myocardial ischemia. This can be caused by diseases such as atherosclerosis, coronary artery disease and aortic stenosis. Angina commonly arises from vasospasm of the coronary arteries. There are multiple mechanisms causing the increased smooth muscle contraction involved in coronary vasospasm, including increased Rho-kinase activity. Increased levels of Rho-kinase inhibit myosin phosphatase activity, leading to increased calcium sensitivity and hypercontraction[3 3]. Rho-kinase also decreases nitric oxide synthase activity, which reduces nitric oxide concentrations[2 2]. Lower levels of nitric oxide are present in spastic coronary arteries[1 1]. L-type calcium channel expression increases in spastic vascular smooth muscle cells, which could result in excessive calcium influx, and hypercontraction[4 4]. Nicorandil is an anti-angina medication that has the dual properties of a nitrate and K+ATP channel agonist[5 5]. In humans, the nitrate action of nicorandil dilates the large coronary arteries at low plasma concentrations[5 5]. At high plasma concentrations nicorandil reduces coronary vascular resistance, which is associated with increased K+ATP channel opening[5 5].

Lefetamine was invented in the 1940s and showed weak analgetic activity. It was investigated in Japan in 1950s. The l-isomere showed weak analgetic action comparable to codeine and antitussive action far weaker than codeine. The d-isomer showed no such activity but caused seizures in rats. It was abused in Japan during the 1950s. In a small study in 1989 it showed some effect against opioid withdrawal symptoms without causing withdrawal symptoms itself. It was concluded that it may be an opioid partial agonist. It has been abused in Europe, in 1989 a small study of 15 abusers and some volunteers found, that it had some partial similarity to opioids, that it produced withdrawal symptoms and had dependence and abuse potential to a certain degree. In a small study in 1994 it was compared to clonidine and buprenorphine for the detoxification of methadone patients and found to be inferior to both for this purpose.

Methylcobalamin (mecobalamin, MeCbl, or MeB) is a cobalamin used in the treatment of peripheral neuropathy, diabetic neuropathy, and as a preliminary treatment for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. It is a form of vitamin B and differs from cyanocobalamin in that the cyanide is replaced by a methyl group. Methylcobalamin features an octahedral cobalt(III) centre. Methylcobalamin can be obtained as bright red crystals. From the perspective of coordination chemistry, methylcobalamin is notable as a rare example of an enzyme that contains metal-alkyl bonds. Nickel-methyl intermediates have been proposed for the final step of methanogenesis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Niaprazine	Niaprazine	71919		R2H3YN6E3L	27367-90-4		Oral		Niaprazine (Nopron) is a sedative-hypnotic drug of the phenylpiperazine class. It has been used in the treatment of sleep disturbances since the early 1970s in several European countries, including France, Italy, and Luxembourg. It is commonly used with children and adolescents on account of its favorable safety and tolerability profile and lack of abuse potential. Originally believed to act as an antihistamine and anticholinergic, niaprazine was later discovered to have no significant binding affinity for either the H1 or the mACh receptors (Ki = > 1 Î¼M), and was instead found to act as a potent and selective 5-HT2A and Î±1-adrenergic receptor antagonist (Ki = 75 nM and 86 nM, respectively). It is virtually inactive at 5-HT1A, 5-HT2B, D2, and Î²-adrenergic, as well as at SERT and VMAT (Ki = all > 1 Î¼M), but it does have some weak affinity for the Î±2-adrenergic receptor (Ki = 730 nM), likely acting as an antagonist there as well. Niaprazine has been shown to metabolize to the compound pFPP in a similar manner to how trazodone and nefazodone metabolize to mCPP. It is unclear what role, if any, pFPP plays in the clinical effects of niaprazine. However, from animal studies it is known that pFPP, unlike niaprazine, does not produce sedative effects, and instead exerts a behavioral profile indicative of serotonergic activation.

Thioacetazone is used in the treatment of tuberculosis; it has only weak activity against Mycobacterium tuberculosis and is only useful in preventing resistance to more powerful drugs like isoniazid and rifampicin. It is never used on its own to treat tuberculosis; it is used in a similar way to ethambutol. Thioacetazone is the only anti-TB drug that is ineffective when given intermittently. There is no advantage to using thioacetazone if the regimen used already contains ethambutol, but many countries in sub-Saharan Africa still use thioacetazone because it is extremely cheap. Use of thioacetazone is declining because it can cause severe (sometimes fatal) skin reactions in HIV positive patients.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Artemisinin	Artemisinin	68827		9RMU91N5K2	63968-64-9		Oral		Artemisinin, also known as Qinghaosu, and its derivatives are a group of drugs that possess the most rapid action of all current drugs against Plasmodium falciparum malaria. Treatments containing an artemisinin derivative (artemisinin-combination therapies, ACTs) are now standard treatment worldwide for P. falciparum malaria. The starting compound artemisinin is isolated from the plant Artemisia annua, sweet wormwood, a herb employed in Chinese traditional medicine. Chemically, artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone containing an unusual peroxide bridge. This peroxide is believed to be responsible for the drug's mechanism of action. Few other natural compounds with such a peroxide bridge are known. Use of the drug by itself as a monotherapy is explicitly discouraged by the World Health Organization, as there have been signs that malarial parasites are developing resistance to the drug. Therapies that combine artemisinin with some other antimalarial drug are the preferred treatment for malaria and are both effective and well tolerated in patients. The drug is also increasingly being used in Plasmodium vivax malaria, as well as being a topic of research in cancer treatment.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Atosiban	Atosiban	5311010		081D12SI0Z	90779-69-4		intravenous		Atosiban (trade names Tractocile, Antocin) is an inhibitor of the hormones oxytocin and vasopressin. It is used as an intravenous medication as a labour repressant (tocolytic) to halt premature labor. Although initial studies suggested it could be used as a nasal spray and hence would not require hospital admission, it is not used in that form. It was developed by Ferring Pharmaceuticals in Sweden and first reported in the literature in 1985. Chemically, it is a modified form of oxytocin that inhibits the action of this hormone on the uterus, leading to a cessation of contractions. A 2005 systematic review by the Cochrane Collaboration showed that while atosiban had fewer side-effects than alternative drugs, it was no better than placebo in the major outcomes, and in one study showed worse neonatal outcomes. The reviewers suggest nifedipine may be more promising.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ibogaine	Ibogaine	197060		3S814I130U	83-74-9		oral		Ibogaine is a naturally occurring psychoactive substance found in a plant in a member of the Apocynaceae family known as Iboga. A hallucinogen with both psychedelic and dissociative properties, the substance is banned in some countries; in other countries it is being used to treat addiction to methadone, heroin, alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and other drugs. Derivatives of ibogaine that lack the substance's hallucinogenic properties are under development. Ibogaine-containing preparations are used in medicinal and ritual purposes within African spiritual traditions of the Bwiti, who claim to have learned it from the Pygmy peoples. Although it was first commonly advertised as having anti-addictive properties in 1962 by Howard Lotsof, its western use predates that by at least a century. In France it was marketed as Lambarene, a medical drug used as a stimulant. Additionally, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) studied the effects of ibogaine in the 1950s. Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid that is obtained either by extraction from the iboga plant or by semi-synthesis from the precursor compound voacangine, another plant alkaloid. A full organic synthesis of ibogaine has been achieved. The synthesis process is too expensive and challenging to be used to produce a commercially significant yield. The synthesis was published with U.S. Patent 2,813,873 in 1956. The free base has been characterised by X-ray crystallography. , while the HBr salt has been characterised also. While ibogaine's prohibition in several countries has slowed scientific research into its anti-addictive properties, the use of ibogaine for drug treatment has grown in the form of a large worldwide medical subculture. Ibogaine is also used to facilitate psychological introspection and spiritual exploration.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mecloqualone	Mecloqualone	9567		09XU4VDV7E	340-57-8				Mecloqualone (Nubarene, Casfen) is an analogue of methaqualone which was first made in 1960 and marketed mainly in France and some other European countries. It has sedative, hypnotic and anxiolytic properties, and was used for the treatment of insomnia. Mecloqualone is faster acting but shorter lasting than methaqualone and so was used only as a sleeping pill, in contrast to methaqualone which was used as a general purpose anxiolytic as well. Mecloqualone was never as widely used as methaqualone and is no longer prescribed because of concerns about its potential for abuse and overdose.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pagoclone	Pagoclone	131664		38VAG2SA33	133737-32-3				Pagoclone is an anxiolytic drug from the cyclopyrrolone family, related to better-known drugs such as the sleeping medication zopiclone. It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures. Pagoclone was originally developed as an anti-anxiety drug, but never commercialised. It is a partial agonist acting at GABAA receptors in the brain. In contrast to zopiclone, pagoclone produces anxiolytic effects with little or no sedative or amnestic actions at low doses. This is because pagoclone is a subtype-selective drug which binds primarily to the Î±2/Î±3 subtypes of the GABAA receptor which are responsible for the anti-anxiety effects of these kind of drugs, but has relatively little efficacy at the Î±1 subtype which produces the sedative and memory loss effects. David Nutt from the University of Bristol has suggested pagoclone as a possible base from which to make a better social drug, as it produces the positive effects of alcohol, such as relaxation and sociability, but without also causing the negative effects like aggression, amnesia, nausea, loss of coordination and liver damage. Its effect can be quickly reversed by the action of flumazenil, which is already used as an antidote to benzodiazepine overdose. Dr. Nutt has published studies praising the potential of pagoclone which were financed by Indevus which holds the patents to the pharmaceutical and is, as of Spring 2006, seeking funding for a possible production of the compound. The significance of this is undetermined, but the long-term safety of pagoclone has not been assessed. The abuse potential of pagoclone has been assessed as being similar to, or slightly less than that of diazepam and it would also be expected to be somewhat safer due to its relatively weaker sedative effects, but development of pagoclone as a recreational drug would still be unlikely due to concerns about abuse. Pagoclone is also being trialed as a drug to improve a stammerer's speech fluency. http://www. stutteringstudy. comhttp://clinicaltrials. gov/ct2/show/NCT00830154

It has stimulant and antidepressant effects which are thought to be due largely to its active metabolite benzylpiperazine. It was researched to a limited extent in Hungary and Spain, but was not widely accepted and does not seem to be in current use, although a closely related drug befuraline with similar effects has been slightly more successful.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pipradrol	Pipradrol	10083		S6I030E0DA	46-76-07				Pipradrol (Meratran) is a mild central nervous system stimulant that is no longer widely used in most countries due to concerns about its abuse potential, although this is less of a problem than with other stimulants that still are in current use such as methylphenidate. Pipradrol is still used in some European countries, and even rarely in the USA. Pipradrol was developed in the 1940s and found use initially for treating obesity. It was subsequently used for the treatment of a variety of other conditions such as narcolepsy, ADHD, and most particularly for counteracting the symptoms of senile dementia, this being the only application for which it is still used medically. Pipradrol proved useful for these applications as its relatively mild stimulant effects gave it a good safety profile compared to stronger stimulants. It was also trialled as an adjutant treatment for depression and schizophrenia although it was never widely used for these purposes. Pipradrol was made illegal in many countries in the late 1970s, at the same time as many other drugs which had a history of abuse. The relatively mild stimulant effects of pipradrol meant that it was scheduled under the less restrictive classes in most countries (i.e. Class C in United Kingdom and New Zealand) but was still considered of sufficient abuse potential to be made an illegal drug. It is now an obscure compound that is virtually unknown as an illicit drug of abuse, but is still used for some scientific research, often as a comparison drug for testing other stimulants against. Dosage is between 0.5 and 4 milligrams per day, typically taken as a single dose in the morning as the long duration of effects of pipradrol (up to 12 hours) means insomnia can be a problem especially if it is used at higher doses or taken too late in the day. Common side effects include insomnia, anorexia, tachycardia, anxiety. Rarer side effects include dry mouth, tremor, hypertension, euphoria, depression, and very rarely psychosis or convulsions.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Semaxanib	Semaxanib	5329098		71IA9S35AJ	194413-58-6				Semaxanib (SU5416) is a tyrosine-kinase inhibitor drug designed by SUGEN as a cancer therapeutic. It is an experimental stage drug, not licensed for use on human patients outside of clinical trials. Semaxanib is a potent and selective synthetic inhibitor of the Flk-1/KDR vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase. It targets the VEGF pathway, and both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated antiangiogenic potential. On February 2002, Pharmacia, the then parent of Sugen, prematurely ended Phase III clinical trials of Semaxinib in the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer due to discouraging results. Other studies, at earlier phases, have since been conducted. However, due to the prospect of next-generation tyrosine kinase inhibitors and the ineffaciousness of semaxanib in clinic trials, further development of the drug has been discontinued. A related compound, SU11248 was further developed by Sugen, and then by Pfizer and was FDA-approved as Sunitinib (Sutent) for treatment of renal carcinoma in January 2006.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Triclofos	Triclofos	5563		J712EO9048	306-52-5				Triclofos is a sedative drug used rarely for treating insomnia, usually as a second-line treatment after other drugs have failed. Triclofos may cause dependence and should not be withdrawn suddenly. This drug should only be used for the short term relief of severe insomnia and should not be mixed with alcohol or other depressant drugs. Patients should not drive or use machinery after taking triclofos. Triclofos is a prodrug which is metabolised in the liver into the active drug trichloroethanol. This delayed action means that the half-life of triclofos is fairly long and it may cause drowsiness the next day. Trichloroethanol may cause liver damage and triclofos should not be used for extended periods.

(Flupyrazapon) is a pyrazolodiazepinone derivative structurally related to the benzodiazepine drugs, which is used as an anaesthetic for a wide range of animals in veterinary medicine. Zolazepam is usually administered in combination with other drugs such as the NMDA antagonist tiletamine or the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist xylazine, depending on what purpose it is being used for. It is around 4 times the potency of diazepam (0.32mg/Kg vs 1.2mg/Kg in animal models) but it is both water-soluble and un-ionized at physiological pH meaning that its onset is very fast. Zolazepam was developed by Horace A. de Wald and Donald E. Butler for Parke Davis and was the result of a very detailed analysis of the benzodiazepine structure (US Patent 3,558,605 filed in 1969). Zolazepam, in combination with tiletamine, has been used in the tranquilization of wild animals, such as gorillas and polar bears, and has been found to be superior to ketamine because of reduced side-effects. A 1:1 mixture of Zolazepam and tiletamine is sold under the name Telazol.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ambroxol	Ambroxol	2132		200168S0CL	18683-91-5				"Ambroxol is a secretolytic agent used in the treatment of respiratory diseases associated with viscid or excessive mucus. It is the active ingredient of Mucosolvan, Mucobrox, Lasolvan, Mucoangin, Surbronc and Lysopain. The substance is a mucoactive drug with several properties including secretolytic and secretomotoric actions that restore the physiological clearance mechanisms of the respiratory tract, which play an important role in the bodyâ€™s natural defence mechanisms. It stimulates synthesis and release of surfactant by type II pneumocytes. Surfactant acts as an anti-glue factor by reducing the adhesion of mucus to the bronchial wall, in improving its transport and in providing protection against infection and irritating agents. Ambroxol is indicated as ""secretolytic therapy in bronchopulmonary diseases associated with abnormal mucus secretion and impaired mucus transport. It promotes mucus clearance, facilitates expectoration and eases productive cough, allowing patients to breathe freely and deeply"". There are many different formulations developed since the first marketing authorisation in 1978. Ambroxol is available as syrup, tablets, pastilles, dry powder sachets, inhalation solution, drops and ampules as well as effervescent tablets. Ambroxol also provides pain relief in acute sore throat. Pain in sore throat is the hallmark of acute pharyngitis. Sore throat is usually caused by a viral infection. The infection is self limited and the patient recovers normally after a few days. What is most bothering for the patient is the continuous pain in the throat maximized when the patient is swallowing. The main goal of treatment is thus to reduce pain. The main property of Ambroxol for treating sore throat is the local anaesthetic effect, described first in the late 1970s, but explained and confirmed in more recent work. Ambroxol is a very potent inhibitor of the neuronal Na+ channels. This property led to the development of a lozenge containing 20Â mg of ambroxol. Many state-of-the-art clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of Ambroxol in relieving pain in acute sore throat, with a fast onset of action and a long duration of effect of at least 3 hours. Additional anti-inflammatory properties of Ambroxol are of clinical relevance since treatment lead to a marked reduction of redness of the patientâ€™s sore throat."

It was originally believed to act as an irreversible inhibitor of PARP1 and possibly other enzymes through covalent modification, but its effects against PARP were later disproven. It underwent clinical trials for treatment of some types of breast cancer, but was discontinued after disappointing Phase III clinical trials. It was the first putative PARP inhibitor to commence phase III clinical trials. The first was for breast cancer, another was for squamous cell lung cancer. Preliminary results in June 2009 on triple-negative breast cancer were promising. Later results showed increased median survival of triple negative breast cancer patients from 7.7 to 12.2 months. However, Phase III results disclosed in January 2011 were disappointing, and development of iniparib as a pharmaceutical has been discontinued. Since December 2009, the FDA had been fast-tracking the New Drug Application of iniparib for triple-negative breast cancer. As of January 2013, iniparib is being studied as a chemotherapeutic agent in the fight against malignant glioma, including glioblastoma.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tremelimumab	Tremelimumab			QEN1X95CIX	745013-59-6				Tremelimumab (formerly ticilimumab, CP-675,206) is a fully human IgG2 monoclonal antibody produced by Pfizer, undergoing human trials for the treatment of cancer. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) can recognize and destroy cancer cells. However, there is also an inhibitory mechanism that interrupts this destruction. Tremelimumab turns off this inhibitory mechanism and allows CTLs to continue to destroy the cancer cells. Tremelimumab binds to the protein CTLA-4, which is expressed on the surface of activated T lymphocytes and inhibits the killing of cancer cells. Tremelimumab blocks the binding of the antigen-presenting cell ligands B7.1 and B7.2 to CTLA-4, resulting in inhibition of B7-CTLA-4-mediated downregulation of T-cell activation; subsequently, B7.1 or B7.2 may interact with another T-cell surface receptor protein, CD28, resulting in a B7-CD28-mediated T-cell activation unopposed by B7-CTLA-4-mediated inhibition. Tremelimumab stimulates patientsâ€™ immune systems to attack their tumors. It has induced durable tumor responses in patients with metastatic melanoma in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies. On April 2, 2008, Pfizer announced that it has discontinued a Phase III clinical trial for patients with advanced melanoma after the review of interim data showed that the trial would not demonstrate superiority to standard chemotherapy. Studies for other tumors are planned as of October 2009, namely for prostate cancer and bladder cancer. On October 4, 2011, MedImmune LLC gained worldwide rights on Tremelimumab to develop and commercialize the drug for treatment of cancer, while Pfizer retains all rights for combination therapies.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Enalaprilat	Enalaprilat			GV0O7ES0R3	76420-72-9				Enalaprilat is the active metabolite of enalapril. It is the first dicarboxylate-containing ACE inhibitor and was developed partly to overcome these limitations of captopril. The sulfhydryl-moiety was replaced by a carboxylate-moiety, but additional modifications were required in its structure-based design to achieve a similar potency to captopril. Enalaprilat, however, had a problem of its own. The consequence of the structural modifications was that it proved to have unfavourable ionisation characteristics to allow sufficient potency for oral administration (in tablets). Thus, enalaprilat was only suitable for intravenous administration. This was overcome by the esterification of enalaprilat with ethanol to produce enalapril. As a prodrug, enalapril is metabolized in vivo to the active form enalaprilat by various esterases. Peak plasma enalaprilat concentrations occur 2 to 4 hours after oral enalapril administration. Elimination thereafter is biphasic, with an initial phase which reflects renal filtration (elimination half-life 2 to 6 hours) and a subsequent prolonged phase (elimination half-life 36 hours), the latter representing equilibration of drug from tissue distribution sites. The prolonged phase does not contribute to drug accumulation on repeated administration but is thought to be of pharmacological significance in mediating drug effects. Renal impairment [particularly creatinine clearance < 20 ml/min (< 1.2 L/h)] results in significant accumulation of enalaprilat and necessitates dosage reduction. Accumulation is probably the cause of reduced elimination in healthy elderly individuals and in patients with concomitant diabetes, hypertension and heart failure.

S. and shown to be able to prevent allergic reactions to accidental exposure to peanuts, which is contained in many kinds of foods.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amphotericin_B	Amphotericin B	14956	DB00681		1397-89-3		slow i.v.-infusion only	renal	Amphotericin B (Fungilin, Fungizone, Abelcet, AmBisome Amfy, Fungisome, Amphocil, Amphotec) is a polyene antifungal drug, often used intravenously for systemic fungal infections. It was originally extracted from Streptomyces nodosus, a filamentous bacterium, in 1955 at the Squibb Institute for Medical Research from cultures of an undescribed streptomycete isolated from the soil collected in the Orinoco River region of Venezuela. Its name originates from the chemical's amphoteric properties. Two amphotericins, amphotericin A and amphotericin B are known, but only B is used clinically, because it is significantly more active in vivo. Amphotericin A is almost identical to amphotericin B (having a double C=C bond between the 27th and 28th carbons), but has little antifungal activity. Currently, the drug is available as plain amphotericin B, as a cholesteryl sulfate complex (ABCD), as a lipid complex (ABLC), and as a liposomal formulation (LAmB). The latter formulations have been developed to improve tolerability for the patient, but may show considerably different pharmacokinetic characteristics compared to plain amphotericin B.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adderall	Adderall	5826	DB01576		51-64-9		Oral, Oral, Insufflated, Intravenous		Adderall is a psychostimulant medication that contains amphetamine, used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Adderall is a combination of four amphetamine salts. It is a dopamine releasing agent, a norepinephrine releasing agent, and can be mildly serotonergic. It is available in two formulations: IR (Instant Release) and XR (Extended Release). The immediate release formulation is indicated for use in ADHD and narcolepsy, while the XR formulation is approved for use only with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Important side effects of therapeutic dextroamphetamine include stunted growth in young people and occasionally a psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses during chronic therapy as a treatment emergent side effect. When abused at high doses, the risk of experiencing side effects and the severity of side effects increases. Side effects may include sweating or shaking. Like other stimulant drugs, such as methamphetamine and cocaine, Adderall directly affects the mesolimbic reward pathway in the brain. Amphetamine salt preparations are considered to have high abuse potential, and it is classified as Schedule II by the US DEA. With the Safe Streets and Communities Act in Canada, Adderall has been reclassified from Schedule III to Schedule I.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihydroetorphine	Dihydroetorphine	107765	DB01450		14357-76-7				Dihydroetorphine was developed by K. W. Bentley at McFarlan-Smith in the 1960s and is a potent analgesic drug (painkiller), which is used mainly in China. It is a derivative of the more well-known opioid etorphine, which is used as a very potent veterinary painkiller and anesthetic medication, primarily for the sedation of large animals such as elephants, giraffes and rhinos. Dihydroetorphine is a semi-synthetic opioid, used mainly as a strong painkiller for humans. It is several thousand times stronger than morphine (between 1000x and 12000x more potent depending what method is used for comparison), although it is poorly absorbed when taken orally. Sublingual forms of dihydroetorphine are used in China at doses ranging from 20 to 40Âµg repeated every 3-4 hours, and are reported to cause strong analgesia and relatively mild side effects compared to other opioids, although all the usual opioid side effects such as dizziness, sedation, nausea, constipation, and respiratory depression can occur. Transdermal patches of dihydroetorphine have also been developed. Dihydroetorphine is considered to be somewhat less addictive than many other opioids, and is also sometimes used in China as a substitute maintenance drug for opioid addicts, in a similar way to how the related drug buprenorphine is used in western nations.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epibatidine	Epibatidine	11031065	DB07720		140111-52-0				Epibatidine is an alkaloid found on the skin of the endangered Ecuadorian frog, Epipedobates tricolor. These frogs, like other poison dart frogs, are best known for their ability to sequester poisons from their prey and secrete these poisons onto their backs. Many Amerindian tribes would swipe the frogs' backs with their blowdarts to provide a much more successful hunt. The one toxin that distinguishes the Epipedobates tricolor from other frogs in this family is epibatidine. The frog uses the compound to protect itself from predators. Animals many times larger would die from the small amounts of epibatidine that the frog secretes. Epibatidine, which was being researched in 1974, turned out to be a very powerful analgesic. This had proven a powerful argument for further research, which has shown that epibatidine has gastrointestinal side effects. This gives the compound a very small therapeutic index and it is very unlikely to ever appear on the medicinal market.

It is a chlor-substituted version of methandrostenolone (Dianabol). Turinabol was the first original product of Jenapharm, an East German pharmaceutical company. The patent registration took place in 1961. The idea of combining the structures of 4-chlorotestosterone and methandrostenolone originated from the chemist Albert Stachowiak. At the time this represented a unique dissociation of anabolic and androgenic effects after oral administration. The product had been introduced for clinical use in 1965.

Human dosage is unknown, but it is likely to be similar in effects to MMDA although perhaps slightly less or more potent due to the presence of the N-methyl group.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Naphthylaminopropane	Naphthylaminopropane	10219723			18085-03-5		Oral		Naphthylisopropylamine (PAL-287) is an experimental drug currently under investigation for the treatment of alcohol and stimulant addiction. Naphthylisopropylamine acts as a non-neurotoxic releasing agent of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine, with EC50 values of 3.4 nM, 11.1 nM, and 12.6 nM, respectively. It also has affinity for the 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, and 5-HT2C receptors (EC50 values = 466 nM, 40 nM, and 2.3 nM, respectively), and acts as a full agonist at 5-HT2B and as a partial agonist at 5-HT2C, while its affinity for 5-HT2A is probably too low to be significant. In animal studies, naphthylisopropylamine was shown to reduce cocaine self-administration, yet produced relatively weak stimulant effects when administered alone, being a (much) lesser stimulant than d-amphetamine for comparison. Further research is now being conducted in primates to see if it will be a useful substitute for treating drug addiction in humans as well. An important observation is that in behavioral studies, rodents would consistently self-administer selective norepinephrine and dopamine releasing agents such as d-amphetamine, yet compounds that also release serotonin like naphthylisopropylamine would not be self-administered. In addition to the drugs (acute) effects on self-administration, all of the available evidence suggests that the locomotor activation caused by the majority of dopamine releasers is also dampened when the drugs also cause 5HTergic release. In fact, PAL-287 causes no locomotor activation at all (although admittedly the tests were only after acute dosing). The high affinity of PAL-287 for 5-HT2C receptors meant that it functioned as a reliable anorectant and was being considered for this indication (i.e. weight loss). However, there were ultimately some concerns raised over the compounds affinity for 5HT2B receptors, since some of the more serious side effects of the serotonin releasing weight loss drug fenfluramine were linked to an activation of this receptor. Apparently, more research will have to be done to assess if PAL-287 causes activation of the 5HT2A and 5HT2B receptors in vivo. However, according to the authors, even the relatively safe drug MDMA causes heart disease, and the incidence being reported for fenfluramine was not that great, even though the evidence being presented was indisputable. Thus it is relatively more likely that any of the more serious side effects from using PAL-287 will only occur in cases of overdose, and not when using a clinically responsible amount of the drug.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desoxymethyltestosterone	Desoxymethyltestosterone	18651			3275-64-7		Oral, IM, Transdermal		"Desoxymethyltestosterone (Madol, Pheraplex) is an anabolic steroid. It was one of the first ""designer steroids"" to be marketed as a performance-enhancing drug to athletes and bodybuilders. In animal studies it has been found to bind to the androgen receptor about as half as strongly as dihydrotestosterone, and caused side effects that are typical of 17Î±-alkylated steroids, such as liver damage when taken in higher dosages and left ventricular hypertrophy. Desoxymethyltestosterone is sometimes referred to as ""DMT"", though it is not the same compound as the hallucinogen dimethyltryptamine, also known as DMT. Desoxymethyltestosterone was invented in 1961 by Max Huffman who obtained a patent on the compound. It was never brought to market as a commercial drug. It was rediscovered by chemist Patrick Arnold in 2005. Arnold produced desoxymethyltestosterone and supplied it to Victor Conte of Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), an American nutritional supplement company and steroid supplier. Desoxymethyltestosterone is unusual in that it is structurally a 2-ene compound, lacking the 3-keto group present on nearly all commercial anabolic steroids. This does not mean it is a weak compound, and clinical research has determined that it is a fairly potent oral agent. Rat studies indicate desoxymethyltestosterone has an anabolic effect 160% that of testosterone while being only 60% as androgenic giving it a Q ratio of 6.5:1. Because of this favorable ratio, experiments in orchiectomised rats have demonstrated that treatment with desoxymethyltestosterone resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle; the prostate and seminal vesicle weights remained unaffected leading the authors of one study to characterize DMT as a powerful anabolic steroid with SARM (selective androgenic receptor modulator) attributes and some indication of toxicity. DMT became a controlled substance in the US on January 4, 2010, and is classified as a Schedule III anabolic steroid under the United States Controlled Substances Act along with boldione and dienedione. The substance had come under scrutiny after it was found to be present in several over-the-counter bodybuilding supplements."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parahexyl	Parahexyl	8334			117-51-1				Parahexyl (Synhexyl, n-hexyl-Î”THC) is a synthetic homologue of THC, which was invented in 1949 during attempts to elucidate the structure of Î”-THC, one of the active components of cannabis. Parahexyl is similar in both structure and activity to THC, differing only in the position of one double bond, and the lengthening of the 3-pentyl chain by one CH2 group to n-hexyl. Parahexyl produces classic cannabis agonist effects in animals. It has a somewhat higher oral bioavailability than THC itself but is otherwise very similar. Presumably it acts as a CB1 agonist in the same way as THC but as there has been no research published using Parahexyl since the discovery of the CB1 receptor this has not been definitively confirmed. Parahexyl was made illegal under UN convention in 1982 on the basis of its structural similarity and similar effects profile to THC, despite never having had any recorded instances of abuse by humans or illicit sale. Parahexyl was placed into the most restrictive Schedule 1 as a compound with no medical use, even though it has never been properly researched to see whether it might have medical use or not.

Glick from the Albany Medical College and the chemist Martin E. Kuehne from the University of Vermont. In animal studies it has proved to be effective at reducing self-administration of morphine, cocaine, methamphetamine, nicotine and sucrose. 18-MC is a selective Î±3Î²4 nicotinic antagonist and, in contrast to ibogaine, has no affinity at the Î±4Î²2 subtype nor at NMDA-channels nor at the serotonin transporter, and has significantly reduced affinity for sodium channels and for the Ïƒ receptor, but retains modest affinity for the Î¼ and Îº opioid receptors. The sites of action in the brain include the medial habenula, interpeduncular nucleus, dorsolateral tegmentum and basolateral amygdala. It has also been shown to produce anorectic effects in obese rats, most likely due to the same actions on the reward system which underlie its anti-addictive effects against drug addiction. 18-MC has not yet been tested in humans. In 2002 the research team started trying to raise funds for human trials, but were unable to secure the estimated $5 million needed. Efforts to raise funds for future trials are still ongoing. In January 2010, Obiter Research, a chemical manufacturer in Champaign, Illinois, signed a patent license with Albany Medical College and the University of Vermont allowing them the right to synthesize and market 18-MC and other congeners. A number of derivatives of 18-MC have also been developed, with several of them being superior to 18-MC itself, the methoxyethyl congener ME-18-MC being more potent than 18-MC but with similar efficacy, and the methylamino analogue 18-MAC being more effective than 18-MC but with around the same potency. These compounds were also found to act as selective Î±3Î²4 nicotinic acetylcholine antagonists, with little or no effect on NMDA receptors.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Catalpol	Catalpol	91520			2415-24-9				Catalpol is an iridoid glucoside that is found in plants belonging to several families, including, but not limited to, Scrophulariaceae, Lamiaceae, and Bignoniaceae, all of which being in the order Lamiales. This natural product falls in the class of iridoid glycosides, which are simply monoterpenes with a glucose molecule attached. First isolated in 1962, catalpol was named for plants in the genus Catalpa in which it was discovered. Later in 1969, catalpol was found to be present in larger quantities in several plants in genus Rehmannia. Although the pharmacological action of catalpol as well as many other iridoids has not been fully established, there is evidence that their primary function is to stimulate the production of adrenal cortical hormones, which increases the production of sex hormones. Catalpol also exhibits anti-inflammatory activity and has shown to increase the production of androgens yielded by the adrenal gland, which can lead to increases in muscle mass.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-019	JWH-019				209414-08-4				JWH-019 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It is the N1-hexyl homologue of the more common synthetic cannabinoid compound JWH-018. Unlike the butyl homologue JWH-073, which is several times weaker than JWH-018, the hexyl homologue is only slightly less potent, although extending the chain one carbon longer to the heptyl homologue JWH-020 results in dramatic loss of activity. These results show that the optimum side chain length for CB1 binding in the naphthoylindole series is the five-carbon pentyl chain, shorter than in the classical cannabinoids where a seven-carbon heptyl chain produces the most potent compounds. This difference is thought to reflect a slightly different binding conformation adopted by the naphthoylindole compounds as compared to the classical cannabinoids, and may be useful in characterising the active site of the CB1 and CB2 receptors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lamivudine/zidovudine	Lamivudine/zidovudine	160352					Oral		Lamivudine/zidovudine (INNs, trade name Combivir) is a pharmaceutical treatment for HIV infection. It is a fixed dose combination of two antiretroviral drugs, lamivudine (also called 3TC, with the brand name Epivir) and zidovudine (also called AZT, with the brand name Retrovir). The drug is a part of the class of medicines called Nucleoside Reverse Transcriptase Inhibitors (NRTIs). Combining of the two drugs has a stronger and more sustained effect than using either drug alone, and assists in reducing pill burden and in aiding compliance with the antiretroviral drug therapy. Both lamivudine and zidovudine are reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which block the action of an enzyme, reverse transcriptase, that the virus requires for reproduction. It reduces the viral load in the body and raises CD4 cell count. It was approved for use in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration on September 26, 1997, making it the thirteenth approved antiretroviral. It is marketed by ViiV Healthcare.

Developed by G. D. Searle & Company, it was first made available to US physicians for trial in patients in 1957. Initially Enovid was marketed only for the treatment of menstrual disorders. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved an application to market it as a contraceptive on 9 March 1961. Just a few months later, in 1961, it was approved as a contraceptive in the UK. Enovid was discontinued in 1988, along with other first-generation high-estrogen COCPs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samarium_(153Sm)_lexidronam	Samarium (153Sm) lexidronam	9810246					http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		Samarium (Sm) lexidronam (chemical name Samarium-153-ethylene diamine tetramethylene phosphonate, abbreviated Samarium-153 EDTMP, trade name Quadramet) is a complex of a radioisotope of the lanthanide element samarium with the chelator EDTMP. It is used to treat pain when cancer has spread to the bone. It is injected into a vein and distributed throughout the body. It is preferentially absorbed in areas where cancer has invaded the bone. There the radioisotope emits beta particles which kill the nearby cancer cells. Pain begins to improve in the first week for most people and the effects can last several months. It is commonly used in lung cancer, prostate cancer, breast cancer, and osteosarcoma. Side effects result from radiation to the bone marrow and include thrombocytopenia and leukopenia.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/THC-O-phosphate	THC-O-phosphate	9865413							THC-O-phosphate is a water-soluble phosphate ester derivative of THC, invented in 1978 in an attempt to get around the poor water solubility of THC and make it easier to inject for the purposes of animal research into its pharmacology and mechanism of action. The main disadvantage of THC phosphate ester is the slow rate of hydrolysis of the ester link, resulting in delayed onset of action and lower potency than the parent drug. THC phosphate ester is made by reacting THC with phosphoryl chloride using pyridine as a solvent, following by quenching with water to produce THC phosphate ester. In the original research the less active but more stable isomer Î”8THC was used, but the same reaction scheme could be used to make the phosphate ester of the more active isomer Î”9THC.

It is manufactured by the McNeil Consumer Healthcare Division of McNeil PPC, Inc. Loperamide is a Î¼-opioid receptor agonist that works in the intestines. Although it is an opioid, it has no effects on the central nervous system. It reduces diarrhea by slowing the transit time of contents through the intestinal tract thereby allowing more water to be reabsorbed from the intestinal lumen. Simethicone reduces gas by allowing smaller gas bubbles to coalesce into larger bubbles in the intestinal tract, making them easier to pass. Simethicone is not absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract so there are no systemic side effects.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methoxyflurane	Methoxyflurane	4116	DB01028	30905R8O7B	76-38-0		Inhalation	70	Methoxyflurane, formerly marketed as Penthrane by Abbott Laboratories, is a halogenated ether that was in clinical use as a volatile inhalational anesthetic from its introduction by Joseph F. Artusio et al in 1960 until the late 1970s. It was first synthesized in the late 1940s by William T. Miller and his team of chemists following their involvement in the Manhattan Project. Methoxyflurane is an extremely potent and highly lipid soluble anesthetic agent, characterized by very slow induction (onset of action) and emergence (offset or dissipation) times. It is non-flammable, has relatively mild hemodynamic effects, and it does not predispose the heart to rhythm disturbances. It is however a significant respiratory depressant. Methoxyflurane has powerful analgesic (pain-relieving) properties at well below full anesthetic doses. It was utilized in self-administration devices for obstetric analgesia, in a manner that foreshadowed the patient-controlled analgesia infusion pumps of today. The biodegradation of methoxyflurane produces inorganic fluoride and dichloroacetic acid (DCAA). The combined effects of these two compounds may be responsible for the toxicity of methoxyflurane to some of the major organs of the human body. Methoxyflurane was determined to be nephrotoxic (damaging to the kidneys) in a dose-dependent response and hepatotoxic (damaging to the liver) at anesthetic doses in 1973, and the drug was abandoned as a general anesthetic in the late 1970s. In 1999, the manufacturer discontinued distribution of methoxyflurane in the United States and Canada, and on September 6, 2005, the Food and Drug Administration determined that it should be withdrawn from the market for safety concerns. It is however still used in Australia as an emergency analgesic for the initial management of pain due to acute trauma, as well as for brief painful procedures such as changing of wound dressings or for transport of injured people.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Miglitol	Miglitol	441314	DB00491	0V5436JAQW	72432-03-2		Oral	Nil	Miglitol is an oral anti-diabetic drug that acts by inhibiting the ability of the patient to break down complex carbohydrates into glucose. It is primarily used in diabetes mellitus type 2 for establishing greater glycemic control by preventing the digestion of carbohydrates into monosaccharides which can be absorbed by the body. Miglitol inhibits glycoside hydrolase enzymes called alpha-glucosidases. Since miglitol works by preventing digestion of carbohydrates, it lowers the degree of postprandial hyperglycemia. It must be taken at the start of main meals to have maximal effect. Its effect will depend on the amount of non-monosaccharide carbohydrates in a person's diet. In contrast to acarbose, miglitol is systemically absorbed; however, it is not metabolized and is excreted by the kidneys.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Montelukast	Montelukast	5281040	DB00471	MHM278SD3E	158966-92-8		Oral	Hepatic	Montelukast (trade names Singulair, Montelo-10 and Monteflo in India) is a leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) used for the maintenance treatment of asthma and to relieve symptoms of seasonal allergies. It is usually administered orally. Montelukast is a CysLT1 antagonist; it blocks the action of leukotriene D4 (and secondary ligands LTC4 and LTE4) on the cysteinyl leukotriene receptor CysLT1 in the lungs and bronchial tubes by binding to it. This reduces the bronchoconstriction otherwise caused by the leukotriene and results in less inflammation. Because of its method of operation, it is not useful for the treatment of acute asthma attacks. Again because of its very specific focus of operation, it does not interact with other asthma medications such as theophylline. Another leukotriene receptor antagonist is zafirlukast (Accolate), taken twice daily. Zileuton (Zyflo), an asthma drug taken four times per day, blocks leukotriene synthesis by inhibiting 5-lipoxygenase, an enzyme of the eicosanoid synthesis pathway. The Mont in Montelukast stands for Montreal, the place where Merck developed the drug.

It is marketed as a prescription under the trade name Xenical by Roche in most countries, and is sold over-the-counter as Alli by GlaxoSmithKline in the United Kingdom and the United States. Its primary function is preventing the absorption of fats from the human diet, thereby reducing caloric intake. It is intended for use in conjunction with a healthcare provider-supervised reduced-calorie diet. Orlistat is the saturated derivative of lipstatin, a potent natural inhibitor of pancreatic lipases isolated from the bacterium Streptomyces toxytricini. However, due to its relative simplicity and stability, orlistat was chosen over lipstatin for development as an anti-obesity drug. The effectiveness of orlistat in promoting weight loss is definite, though modest. Pooled data from clinical trials suggest that people given orlistat in addition to lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, lose about 2â€“3 kilograms (&#160) more than those not taking the drug over the course of a year. Orlistat also modestly reduces blood pressure, and appears to prevent the onset of type 2 diabetes, whether due to weight loss itself or to other effects; in a large randomized controlled trial, orlistat was found to reduce the incidence of diabetes by nearly 40% in obese people. Orlistat is notorious for its gastrointestinal side effects (sometimes referred to as treatment effects), which can include steatorrhea (oily, loose stools). These decrease with time, however, and are the most frequently reported adverse effects of the drug. In the United States, the European Union, and Australia, orlistat is available for sale without a prescription. Over-the-counter approval was controversial in the United States, with consumer advocacy group Public Citizen repeatedly opposing it on safety and efficacy grounds. Generic formulations of orlistat are available in some countries. At times, such as in spring 2012, Orlistat has come into short supply, with consequent price changes,like hikes and lowering because of nonavailability of one of the drug's components.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pemoline	Pemoline	4723	DB01230	7GAQ2332NK	2152-34-3		Oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Pemoline is a stimulant drug of the oxazoline class. It was first synthesized in 1913 but its activity was not discovered until the 1930s. Under the names Betanamin, Cylert, Tradon, and Ceractiv it was used as a medication to treat attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and narcolepsy. Under the Convention on Psychotropic Substances, it is a Schedule IV drug. It is no longer generally available in the United States. Pemoline magnesium, a chelate between pemoline and magnesium, displays certain pharmacological advantages over pemoline. The compound is the monohydrate of an equimolar mixture between pemoline and magnesium hydroxide. The absorption of pemoline magnesium is more rapid and the duration of action is extended, and the effect is more reliable.

It was used primarily to reduce the pain of intramuscular injection of penicillin, and it was also used in dentistry. Owing to the ubiquity of the trade name Novocain, in some regions procaine is referred to generically as novocaine. It acts mainly by being a sodium channel blocker. Procaine was first synthesized in 1905, shortly after amylocaine. It was created by the German chemist Alfred Einhorn who gave the chemical the trade name Novocaine, from the Latin nov- (meaning new) and -caine, a common ending for alkaloids used as anesthetics. It was introduced into medical use by surgeon Heinrich Braun. Prior to the discovery of Stovaine and Novocaine, cocaine was the most commonly used local anesthetic."

It is a non-selective competitive Î²-adrenergic receptor blocker that also exhibits Class III antiarrhythmic properties by its inhibition of potassium channels. Because of this dual action, Sotalol prolongs both the PR interval and the QT interval. Originally discovered around 1960, sotalol became widely used first as a Î²-blocker in the 1980s, and its function as an antiarrhythmic drug was discovered soon after. Due to the dual action of sotalol, it is often used preferentially to other Î²-blockers as treatment for both ventricular fibrillation and ventricular tachycardia.

It is a short-acting nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that potentiates GABA, an inhibitory neurotransmitter, by binding to GABAA receptors at the same location as benzodiazepines. It works quickly, usually within 15 minutes, and has a short half-life of two to three hours. Zolpidem has not adequately demonstrated effectiveness in maintaining sleep, unless delivered in a controlled-release (CR) form. However, it is effective in initiating sleep. Its hypnotic effects are similar to those of the benzodiazepine class of drugs, but it is molecularly distinct from the classical benzodiazepine molecule and is classified as an imidazopyridine. Flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist, which is used for benzodiazepine overdose, can also reverse zolpidem's sedative/hypnotic and memory-impairing effects. As a muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant, the drug's effects are not evident until dosages 10 and 20 times those required for sedation, respectively, are reached. For that reason, zolpidem has never been approved for either muscle relaxation or seizure prevention. Such drastically increased doses are also more inclined to induce one or more of the drug's adverse side effects, including hallucinations and amnesia. The United States patent for zolpidem was held by the French pharmaceutical corporation Sanofi-Aventis. On April 23, 2007, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved 13 generic versions of zolpidem tartrate. Zolpidem is available from several generic manufacturers in the UK, as a generic from Sandoz in South Africa and TEVA in Israel, as well as from other manufacturers such as Ratiopharm (Germany). On January 10, 2013, the Food and Drug Administration announced it is requiring the manufacturer of Ambien and Zolpimist to cut the recommended dosage for women in half, after laboratory studies showed that the medicines can leave patients drowsy in the morning and at risk for car accidents. The FDA recommended that manufacturers extend the new dosage cuts to men as well, who process the drug at a faster rate. However, the reasons why men and women catabolize the drugs at different rates is still unknown.

It is an isomer of DDD and is a derivative of DDT. Its main use is in those patients who have persistent disease despite surgical resection, those who are not surgical candidates, or those who have metastatic disease. It has been produced by Bristol Myers Squibb SpA but it is marketed as an orphan drug due to the small number of patients in need of it. A 2007 study of 177 patients shows a significant increase in the recurrence-free interval after radical surgery followed by mitotane when compared to surgery alone. Mitotane alters steroid peripheral metabolism, directly suppresses the adrenal cortex and alters cortisone metabolism leading to hypocortisolism. Side effects as reported by Schteinberg et al. include anorexia and nausea (88%), diarrhea (38%), vomiting (23%), decreased memory and ability to concentrate (50%), rash (23%), gynecomastia (50%), arthralgia (19%), and leukopenia (7%).

Neamine (two rings), ribostamycin (three rings), paromomycin (four rings), and lividomycin (five rings) are some other examples of aminoglycosides. They have shown tremendous potential as antibacterials. One of them, gentamicin, has been used extensively in clinical practice. Due to the inherent oto- and nephrotoxicity of these substances, systemic use has declined, as safer alternatives have become available.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxytetracycline	Oxytetracycline	5353856	DB00595	SLF0D9077S	79-57-2		Oral, Ophthalmic		Oxytetracycline was the second of the broad-spectrum tetracycline group of antibiotics to be discovered. Oxytetracycline works by interfering with the ability of bacteria to produce essential proteins. Without these proteins, the bacteria cannot grow, multiply and increase in numbers. Oxytetracycline therefore stops the spread of the infection and the remaining bacteria are killed by the immune system or eventually die. Oxytetracycline is a broad-spectrum antibiotic, active against a wide variety of bacteria. However, some strains of bacteria have developed resistance to this antibiotic, which has reduced its effectiveness for treating some types of infections. Oxytetracycline is still used to treat infections caused by Chlamydia (e.g. the chest infection psittacosis, the eye infection trachoma, and the genital infection urethritis) and infections caused by Mycoplasma organisms (e.g. pneumonia). Oxytetracycline is also used to treat acne, due to its activity against the bacteria on the skin that cause acne. It is used to treat flare-ups of chronic bronchitis, due to its activity against the bacteria usually responsible, Haemophilus influenzae. Oxytetracycline may also be used to treat other rarer infections, such as those caused by a group of micro-organisms called rickettsiae (e.g. Q fever). To make sure the bacteria causing an infection are susceptible to it, a tissue sample is usually taken, for example a swab from the infected area, or a urine or blood sample.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acetyldihydrocodeine	Acetyldihydrocodeine	5463874	DB01538	SGY1T84P34	3861-72-1				Acetyldihydrocodeine is an opiate derivative discovered in Germany in 1914 and was used as a cough suppressant and analgesic. It is not commonly used, but has activity similar to other opiates. Acetyldihydrocodeine can be described as the 6-acetyl derivative of dihydrocodeine and is metabolised in the liver by demethylation and deacetylation to produce dihydromorphine. Since acetyldihydrocodeine has higher lipophilicity than codeine and is converted into dihydromorphine rather than morphine, it can be expected to be more potent and longer lasting, and also have higher bioavailability than codeine. Side effects are similar to those of other opiates and include itching, nausea and respiratory depression. Although an opioid of low to moderate strength and use in medicine elsewhere in the world, acetyldihydrocodeine is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States. Its DEA Administrative Controlled Substances Control Number is 9051 and the one salt in use, acetyldihydrocodeine hydrochloride, has a freebase conversion ratio of 0.90.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dirithromycin	Dirithromycin	6917067	DB00954	1801D76STL	62013-04-1				Dirithromycin is a macrolide glycopeptide antibiotic. Dirithromycin (Dynabac) is a more lipid-soluble prodrug derivative of 9S-erythromycyclamine prepared by condensation of the latter with 2-(2-methoxyethoxy)acetaldehyde. The 9N, 11O-oxazine ring thus formed is a hemi-aminal that is unstable under both acidic and alkaline aqueous conditions and undergoes spontaneous hydrolysis to form erythromycyclamine. Erythromycyclamine is a semisynthetic derivative of erythromycin in which the 9-ketogroup of the erythronolide ring has been converted to an amino group. Erythromycyclamine retains the antibacterial properties of erythromycin oral administration. The prodrug, dirithromycin, is provided as enteric coated tablets to protect it from acid catalyzed hydrolysis in the stomach. Orally administered dirithromycin is absorbed rapidly into the plasma, largely from the small intestine. Spontaneous hydrolysis to erythromycyclamine occurs in the plasma. Oral bioavailability is estimated to be about 10%, but food does not affect absorption of the prodrug.

It is used in low doses and may have less marked adverse effects, although it is unclear whether the recommended dose is as effective as are standard doses of nicotinic acid. Acipimox inhibits the production of triglycerides by the liver and the secretion of VLDL, which leads indirectly to a modest reduction in LDL and increase in HDL. Long-term administration is associated with reduced mortality, but unwanted effects limit its clinical use. Adverse effects include flushing (associated with Prostaglandin D2), palpitations, and GI disturbances. Flushing can be reduced by taking aspirin 20-30 min before taking Acipimox. High doses can cause disorders of liver function, impair glucose tolerance and precipitate gout. Brands availableÂ : Acipicap from Zydus Cadila

It has been shown to significantly inhibit growth of breast cancer in xenograft models and has been successful in trials with renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and several other tumor types. A Phase II clinical trial showed good response in combination chemotherapy with gemcitabine for advanced pancreatic cancer. However, Pfizer reported on January 30, 2009 that Phase III clinical trials of the drug when used in combination with gemcitabine showed no evidence of improved survival rates over treatments using gemcitabine alone for advanced pancreatic cancer and halted the trial. In 2010, a Phase III trial for previously treated metastatic renal cell carcinoma (mRCC) showed significantly extended progression-free survival when compared to sorafenib. In December 2011, the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee (ODAC) voted unanimously to recommend the approval of axitinib for the second-line treatment of patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), based on the results of the Phase III trial comparing axitinib and sorafenib. On January 27, 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved axitinib for use in patients with renal cell carcinoma that had failed to respond to a previous treatment.

Phase II trials were conducted in 1996 and brasofensine was shown to be both effective and well tolerated at a dose of 4Â mg, however development was stopped after in vivo cis-anti isomerization of the 2Î±-methyloxime group was reported. In animal models of Parkinson's disease, brasofensine was effective in stimulating LMA and reversing akinesia. The isomerization of brasofensine is not between the alpha and beta positions on the 2 position of the tropane ring but rather the E/Z isomerization of the imine (i.e. ""methyl-aldoxime""). It was believed that this process occurs in vivo although it cannot be ruled out as a possibility that some isomerization also occurs prior to ingestion. The (Z)-isomer has been consigned the name BMS-205912 In PD, symptoms do not begin to manifest until there has been an 80% reduction in dopaminergic neurons, particularly in the substantia nigra brain region."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Capromorelin	Capromorelin	216208		0MQ44VUN84	193273-66-4				Capromorelin (CP-424,391) is an investigational medication developed by the Pfizer drug company. It functions as a growth hormone secretagogue and ghrelin mimetic which causes the body to secrete human growth hormone in a way usually seen at puberty and in young adulthood. Initial studies have shown the drug to directly raise insulin growth factor 1 and growth hormone levels. The drug is being considered for its therapeutic value in aging adults because elderly people have much lower levels of growth hormone and less lean muscle mass, which can result in weakness and frailty. In a one-year treatment trial (starting 1999) with 395 seniors between 65 and 84 years old, patients who received the drug gained an average of 3Â lb (1.4Â kg) in lean body mass in the first six months and also were better able to walk in a straight line in a test of balance, strength and coordination. After 12 months, patients receiving capromorelin also had an improved ability to climb stairs, however the results were not good enough to continue the trial for the 2nd planned year. Capromorelin, however, has not been approved by major regulatory bodies such as the World Health Organization, the European Medicines Agency or the United States FDA. In the U.S. at least, approval is not expected to be forthcoming any time soon, because the FDA does not consider aging a disease, and so requires extraordinary evidence of benefit and non-toxicity to approve a drug for use as an anti-aging agent.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Efaproxiral	Efaproxiral	122335		J81E81G364	131179-95-8				Efaproxiral is an analog of the cholesterol drug bezafibrate developed for the treatment of depression, traumatic brain injury, ischemia, stroke, myocardial infarction, diabetes, hypoxia, sickle cell disease, hypercholesterolemia and as a radio sensitizer. The chemical is a propanoic acid in the class of amphipathic carboxylic acids. Most propanoic acid produced is consumed as a preservative for both animal feed and food for human consumption. One use for efaproxiral is to increase the efficacy of certain chemotherapy drugs which have reduced efficacy against hypoxic tumours, and can thus be made more effective by increased offloading of oxygen into the tumour tissues. No benefit was seen for efaproxiral in phase III clinical trials. The increased oxygenation of tissues could theoretically also produce enhanced exercise capacity in feline, rat and canine models for approximately 100 min. immediately after a high dosage 45 min. intravenous infusion. This has led World Anti-Doping Agency to categorize efaproxiral under a prohibited method to artificially enhance the uptake, transport or delivery of oxygen. There is no existing evidence that efaproxiral can effectively enhance performance in humans. Efaproxiral can be absorbed via transdermal, rectal, inhalation and gastrointestinal routes, though not at plasma concentrations great enough to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve. Efaproxiral is explicitly excluded from the 2012 World Anti-Doping Agency list of Prohibited Substances and is explicitly included in the Prohibited Methods section M1 as a forbidden procedure to alter the oxygen-haemoglobin dissociation curve in order to allosterically modify hemoglobin.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Andarine	Andarine	9824562	DB07423		401900-40-1				Andarine (GTx-007, S-4) is an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed by GTX, Inc for treatment of conditions such as muscle wasting, osteoporosis and benign prostatic hypertrophy, using the non-steroidal androgen antagonist bicalutamide as a lead compound. Andarine is an orally active partial agonist for androgen receptors. It is less potent in both anabolic and androgenic effects than other SARMs. In an animal model of benign prostatic hypertrophy, andarine was shown to reduce prostate weight with similar efficacy to finasteride, but without producing any reduction in muscle mass or anti-androgenic side effects. This suggests that it is able to competitively block binding of dihydrotestosterone to its receptor targets in the prostate gland, but its partial agonist effects at androgen receptors prevent the side effects associated with the anti-androgenic drugs traditionally used for treatment of BPH.

It is then metabolized further by conjugation with glucuronide, forming a water-soluble congener which can be more easily excreted by the body. 11-COOH-THC is not psychoactive itself, but has a long half-life in the body of up to several days (or even weeks in very heavy users), making it the main metabolite tested for when blood or urine testing for cannabis use. More sensitive tests are able to distinguish between 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC, which can help determine how recently cannabis was consumed; if only 11-COOH-THC is present then the cannabis was used some time ago and any impairment in cognitive ability or motor function will have dissipated, whereas if both 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC are present then the cannabis was consumed more recently and motor impairment may still be present. Some jurisdictions where cannabis use is decriminalized or permitted under some circumstances use such tests when determining whether drivers were legally intoxicated and therefore unfit to drive, with the comparative levels of THC, 11-OH-THC and 11-COOH-THC being used to derive a ""blood cannabis level"" analogous to the blood alcohol level used in prosecuting impaired drivers. On the other hand in jurisdictions where cannabis is completely illegal, any detectable levels of 11-COOH-THC may be deemed to constitute driving while intoxicated, even though this approach has been criticized as tantamount to prohibition of ""driving whilst being a regular user of cannabis"" regardless of the presence or absence of any actual impairment that might impact on driving performance. While 11-COOH-THC does not have any psychoactive effects in its own right, it may still have a role in the analgesic and antiinflammatory effects of cannabis, and has also been shown to moderate the effects of THC itself which may help explain the difference in subjective effects seen between occasional and regular users of cannabis."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethylphenidate	Ethylphenidate	3080846			57413-43-1		Insufflation, Vaporized	Hepatic transesterification of prodrugs methylphenidate and ethanol	Ethylphenidate (EP) is a potent psychostimulant that acts as both a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, meaning it effectively boosts the levels of the norepinephrine and dopamine neurotransmitters in the brain, by binding to, and partially blocking the transporter proteins that normally remove those monoamines from the synaptic cleft. It is most commonly formed when ethanol and methylphenidate are coingested, via hepatic transesterification. Ethylphenidate formation appears to be more common when large quantities of methylphenidate and alcohol are consumed at the same time, such as in non-medical use or overdose scenarios. This carboxylesterase-dependent transesterification process is also known to occur when cocaine and alcohol are consumed together, forming cocaethylene. Ethylphenidate is more selective to the dopamine transporter (DAT) than methylphenidate, having approximately the same efficacy as the parent compound, but has significantly less activity on the norepinephrine transporter (NET). It has a near-identical dopaminergic pharmacodynamic profile as methylphenidate, which is primarily responsible for its euphoric and reinforcing effects. The eudysmic ratio for ethylphenidate is superior to that of methylphenidate.

The addition of a phenyl ring allows phenibut to cross the blood brain barrier. Phenibut is sold as a nutritional supplement, and is not approved as a pharmaceutical in the United States or Europe, but in Russia it is sold as a neuropsychotropic drug. It has been reported by some to possess nootropic actions for its ability to improve neurological functions, however other researchers have not observed these effects. It is generally accepted that phenibut has anxiolytic effects in both animal models and in humans. Phenibut was discovered in the Soviet Union in the 1960s, and has since been used there to treat a wide range of ailments including post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, and insomnia. The name phenibut, along with many of the other names for the compound, comes directly from the chemical name for the compound, Î²-phenyl-Î³-aminobutyric acid.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diacetyldihydromorphine	Diacetyldihydromorphine	5359460			509-71-7		Intravenous		Diacetyldihydromorphine (also known as paralaudin, dihydroheroin or acetylmorphinol) is a potent opiate derivative developed in Germany in 1929 which is rarely used in some countries for the treatment of severe pain such as that caused by terminal cancer, as a more potent form of diamorphine (also commonly known as Heroin). Diacetyldihydromorphine is fast acting and longer lasting than diamorphine, with a duration of action of around 4-7 hours. Diacetyldihydromorphine is quickly metabolized by plasma esterase enzymes into dihydromorphine, in the same way that diamorphine is metabolized into morphine; however unlike dihydromorphine, which is more potent than morphine on a mg to mg basis, diacetyldihydromorphine is actually less potent than diamorphine, perhaps because it is metabolized more slowly. Diacetyldihydromorphine is approximately equipotent to morphine whereas diamorphine is 1.50-1.80 times the potency of morphine. It shares with other opioids the risk of overdose or (potentially life-threatening) respiratory depression. When strong narcotics are required, and morphine and diamorphine are not an option, it is more common to use better known drugs such as nicomorphine, hydromorphone, levorphanol, oxymorphone or fentanyl which doctors will be more familiar with, and which do not share the stigma associated with either heroin or morphine. Side effects of diacetyldihydromorphine are similar to those of other semi-synthetic opiates and fully synthetic opioids, and the most commonly reported side effects include drowsiness, nausea, and constipation. Compared to morphine, diacetyldihydromorphine produces far fewer side effects which are also often lower in intensity. Though the two drugs are very similar in effects, morphine often produces more intense side effects, including euphoria, constipation, miosis, physical dependence, psychological dependence, potentially life-threatening respiratory depression, and a severe addiction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nabitan	Nabitan	39503			66556-74-9				Nabitan (Nabutam, Benzopyranoperidine, SP-106, Abbott 40656) is a synthetic cannabinoid analog of dronabinol (Marinol). It exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects, most likely by binding to and activating the CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors, and reduced intraocular pressure in animal tests, making it potentially useful in the treatment of glaucoma. Nabitan has the advantage of being water soluble unlike most cannabinoid derivatives, and was researched for potential use as an analgesic or sedative, although it was never developed for clinical use and is not currently used in medicine, as dronabinol or nabilone were felt to be more useful. However it is sometimes used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pristinamycin	Pristinamycin	11979535			270076-60-3				Pristinamycin, also spelled pristinamycine, is an antibiotic used primarily in the treatment of staphylococcal infections, and to a lesser extent streptococcal infections. It is a streptogramin group antibiotic, similar to virginiamycin, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces pristinaespiralis. It is marketed in Europe by Sanofi-Aventis under the trade name Synercid and Pyostacine. Pristinamycin is a mixture of two components that have a synergistic antibacterial action. Pristinamycin IA is a macrolide, and results in pristinamycin having a similar spectrum of action to erythromycin. Pristinamycin IIA (streptogramin A) is a depsipeptide. PI and PII are coproduced by S. pristinaespiralis in a ratio of 30:70. Each compound binds to the bacterial 50 S ribosomal subunit and inhibits the elongation process of the protein synthesis, thereby exhibiting only a moderate bacteriostatic activity. However, the combination of both substances acts synergistically and leads to a potent bactericidal activity that can reach up to 100 times that of the separate components. The pristinamycin biosynthetic gene cluster is the largest antibiotic supercluster known so far with a size of ~210 kb, where the PI and PII biosynthetic genes are not clustered individually but are scattered across the complete sequence region. Furthermore, this biosynthetic gene region is interrupted by a cryptic type II PKS gene cluster.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/25I-NBOH	25I-NBOH	10001761			919797-20-9				25I-NBOH (NBOH-2CI, Cimbi-27) is a derivative of the phenethylamine derived hallucinogen 2C-I. It acts as a potent agonist for the 5HT2A receptor, with a Ki of 0.061nM at the human 5HT2A receptor, making it some twelve times the potency of 2C-I itself. In vitro tests showed this compound acted as an agonist but animal studies have not been reported. While the N-benzyl derivatives of 2C-I were significantly increased in potency compared to 2C-I, the N-benzyl derivatives of DOI were inactive. It was discovered in 2006 by a team at Purdue University.

It acts as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, but acts more like an antidepressant than a stimulant. It is currently unclear whether the 4-halogenated cathinones share the selective serotonergic neurotoxicity of their corresponding amphetamines.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-MeO-2-TMT	5-MeO-2-TMT	49756			67292-68-6				"5-Methoxy-2,N,N-trimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-2,N,N-TMT, 5-MeO-TMT) is a psychoactive drug of the tryptamine chemical class which acts as a psychedelic. It was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book TiHKAL (""Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved""). 5-MeO-TMT is claimed to show psychoactive effects at a dosage of 75-150Â mg orally, but these are relatively mild compared to those of other similar compounds. This suggests that while the methyl group on the 2-position of the molecule has impaired the binding of metabolic enzymes like monoamine oxidase (MAO), it is also interfering with binding to and/or activation of the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor, the target responsible for mediating the hallucinogenic effects of such compounds."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine	6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine	5492874			3414-84-4				6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine (6-MDDM) is an opiate analogue that is a derivative of hydromorphone, where the 6-ketone group has been replaced by a methylene group. It has sedative and analgesic effects. 6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine is a potent Î¼-opioid agonist, 80x stronger than morphine. Compared to morphine it has a faster onset of action and similar duration of effects. It produces around the same degree of respiratory depression as morphine, but less inhibition of gastrointestinal motility. Animal studies show it to be a potent analgesic which produces significant analgesic effects even at low doses which produce comparatively few side effects, however it has never been developed for medical use in humans. 6-Methylenedihydrodesoxymorphine is synthesised in two steps; first a Wittig reaction is used, reacting hydrocodone with methylenetriphenylphosphorane and an alkyl lithium reagent in diethyl ether to form 6-Methylenedihydrodesoxycodeine. The 3-methoxy group is then cleaved to hydroxy, by reaction with pyridine. The second step tends to be incomplete and often gives fairly low yields, but these can be improved by changing the reaction conditions.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/ABT-418	ABT-418	119380			147402-53-7				ABT-418 is a drug developed by Abbott, which acts as an agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It binds with high affinity to the Î±4Î²2, Î±2Î²2 and Î±7 subtypes, but not to the Î±3Î²4 subtype. It has nootropic, neuroprotective and anxiolytic effects, and has been researched for treatment of both Alzheimer's disease and more recently ADHD. ABT-418 was reasonably effective for both applications and fairly well tolerated, but produced some side effects, principally nausea, and it is unclear whether ABT-418 itself will proceed to clinical development or if another similar drug will be used instead.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adjudin	Adjudin	9819086			252025-52-8				Adjudin (AF-2364) is a drug which is under development as a potential non-hormonal male contraceptive drug, which acts by blocking the production of sperm in the testes, but without affecting testosterone production. It is an analogue of the chemotherapy drug lonidamine, an indazole-carboxylic acid, and further studies continue to be conducted into this family of drugs as possible contraceptives. As of 1Â MayÂ 2007Â (2007-05-01), adjudin was in phase II human trials. As shown in mature male rats, the agent induces reversible germ cell loss from the seminiferous epithelium by disrupting cell adhesion function between Sertoli and germ cells. It weakens the adhesion between the Sertoli cell and maturing sperm leading to a sloughing and loss of the latter. As it does not affect spermatogonia themselves the loss of fertility is reversible. In experiments hormonal levels were undisturbed during administration, and normal spermatogenesis returned in 95% of the tubules of rats at 210 days after the drug had been discontinued. When taken orally, the drug has very low bioavailability. The oral dose effective for contraception is so high that there have been side effects in the muscles and liver. Coupling an Adjudin molecule to a mutant form of follicle-stimulating hormone may solve this problem. The mutant FSH is modified such that it no longer induces Inhibin B production, but the membrane-bound FSH receptors on Sertoli cells still bind to it, delivering the Adjudin directly to the target cells. The adjudin-FSH can be either injected, delivered in an implant, or as a gel.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Allylnorpethidine	Allylnorpethidine	16915			2372-70-5				Allylnorpethidine (WIN-7681) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is related to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine). Allylnorpethidine is an analogue of pethidine where the N-methyl group has been replaced by allyl. In many other opioid derivatives, placing an allyl substituent on the nitrogen instead of a methyl will reverse the normal opioid effects, to produce Î¼-opioid antagonists which among other things reverse the respiratory depression caused by opioid agonists such as morphine. This is not true with allylnorpethidine, as while it does partially reverse the respiratory depression produced by morphine it is actually an active analgesic and has no antagonistic properties when administered alone, so is instead a partial agonist.

BML-190 is structurally derived from the NSAID indomethacin but has a quite different biological activity. The activity produced by this compound is disputed, with some sources referring to it as a CB2 agonist rather than an inverse agonist; this may reflect an error in classification, or alternatively it may produce different effects in different tissues, more research is required to resolve this dispute.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/BW373U86	BW373U86	10025998			150428-54-9				(+)BW373U86 is an opioid analgesic drug used in scientific research. BW373U86 is a selective agonist for the Î´-opioid receptor, with approximately 15x stronger affinity for the Î´-opioid than the Î¼-opioid receptor. It has potent analgesic and antidepressant effects in animal studies, and triggers release of the neural growth factor BDNF, but its usefulness is limited by producing convulsions at high doses, although the convulsive effect is reduced when it is co-administered with Î¼-opioid agonists. Another advantage of the combination is that BW373U86 reverses the respiratory depression produced by Î¼-opioid agonists, without affecting pain relief. Another useful effect of BW373U86 is that it protects heart muscle cells from death in conditions of ischemia (oxygen deprivation, such as in heart attack). The mechanism for this is complex and may be separate from its delta agonist effects.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chloromorphide	Chloromorphide	5745724			63783-53-9				Chloromorphide (Î±-chloromorphide) is an opiate analog that is a derivative of morphine, where the 6-hydroxy group has been replaced by chlorine. Developed in 1933 in Germany, it has approximately ten times the potency of morphine. It has similar effects to morphine such as sedation, analgesia and respiratory depression. Chloromorphide is one of a series of opioids known as morphides and codides which are important precursors and intermediates in the synthesis of semi-synthetic opioid analgesic drugs, especially those with additions, substitutions, or other modifications at the 7, 8, and/or 14 position on the morphine carbon skeleton. Semisynthetics with changes at other positions can also be made from these compounds. The codeine analog of chloromorphide is Î±-chlorocodide (alphachlorcodide), an intermediate in one method of desomorphine synthesis which uses codeine as precursor. During the 1930s, the entire series of alpha- and beta-halogenated codides, morphides, dihydromorphides, and dihydrocodides were produced and described, and Î±-bromomorphide and Î±-iodomorphide are sometimes currently used in research and manufacturing.

It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, in an attempt to develop non-lethal incapacitating agents. EA-3167 has identical effects to QNB, but is even more potent and longer lasting, with an effective dose when administered by injection of as little as 2.5Î¼g/kg (i.e. 0.2 milligrams for an 80kg person), and a duration of 120-240 hours (5-10 days).

It combines Gilead Sciences's tenofovir and emtricitabine (already available in the anti-HIV combination Truvada) with Bristol-Myers Squibb's efavirenz into a fixed-dose pill. Combining the three drugs into a single, once-daily pill reduces pill burden and simplifies dosing schedules, and therefore has the potential to increase adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Atripla is the first multi-class antiretroviral drug available in the United States and represents the first collaboration between two U.S. pharmaceutical companies to combine their patented anti-HIV drugs into one product. The drug retails in the United States for US$1,850 for a one-month supply. As of 2007, annual cost in India is US$1,344, and US$528 in Africa. It was approved by the U.S. FDA on July 12, 2006. In the UK, the drug cost to the NHS is GBÂ£626.90 per month as of March 2012. Atripla is a fixed dose combination of 600Â mg efavirenz, 300Â mg tenofovir, and 200Â mg emtricitabine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/AL-34662	AL-34662				210580-75-9				AL-34662 is an indazole derivative drug that is being developed for the treatment of glaucoma. It acts as a selective 5-HT2A receptor agonist, the same target as that of hallucinogenic drugs like psilocin, but unlike these drugs, AL-34662 was designed specifically as a peripherally selective drug, which does not cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier. This means that AL-34662 can exploit a useful side effect of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A agonists, namely reduction in intra-ocular pressure and hence relief from the symptoms of glaucoma, but without causing the hallucinogenic effects that make centrally active 5-HT2A agonists unsuitable for clinical use. In animal studies, AL-34662 has been shown to be potent and effective in the treatment of symptoms of glaucoma, with minimal side effects. Peripherally acting 5-HT2A agonists have been a rich field of research in recent years, with potential glaucoma treatments being the main proposed application for 5-HT2A agonists at present, as centrally acting agonists for this receptor tend to be hallucinogenic and thus have little medical use. While many novel, potent and selective 5-HT2A agonists have been developed for this application, retaining peripheral selectivity can be a problem, and several of the more lipophilic compounds closely related to AL-34662 such as those shown below, did cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier and produced hallucinogen-appropriate responding in animals.

The name of the genus itself is based on the Greek word for heart. Friction particles are made by polymerizing the unsaturated side chain of cardanol, followed by cross-polymerization with phenol to yield a cardanol-formaldehyde resin by a process analogous to the formation of phenol-formaldehyde resins such as Bakelite. Cardanol-phenol resins were developed in the 1920s by Mortimer T. Harvey, then a student at Columbia University. These resins found use in vehicle brakes after it was found that they had a coefficient of friction that was less sensitive to temperature changes than phenol-formaldehyde resins. Despite all these uses, only a fraction of the cardanol obtained from cashew nut processing is used in the industrial field. Therefore, there is still interest in developing new applications, such as new polymers. The name cardanol is used for the decarboxylated derivatives obtained by thermal decomposition of any of the naturally occurring anacardic acids. This includes more than one compound because the composition of the side chain varies in its degree of unsaturation. Tri-unsaturated cardanol, the major component (41%) is shown below. The remaining cardanol is 34% mono-unsaturated, 22% bi-unsaturated, and 2% saturated. In terms of physical properties, cardanol is comparable to nonylphenol. Cardanol is hydrophobic and remains flexible and liquid at very low temperatures; its freezing point is below âˆ’20 Â°C, it has a density of 0.930 g/mL, and boils at 225 Â°C under reduced pressure. CAS registry number: 37330-39-5.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Edrecolomab	Edrecolomab				156586-89-9				Edrecolomab (MAb17-1A, trade name Panorex) is a mouse-derived monoclonal antibody targeting the cell-surface glycoprotein EpCAM (17-1A), which is expressed on epithelial tissues and on various carcinomas. Preliminary studies had shown promise of a possible use in patients with stage III colorectal carcinoma. However, when put to a phase III study (2,761 patients) it did not provide any benefit when compared to conventional chemotherapeutic agents. No effect has been demonstrated for stage II (locally advanced cancer without spread to the lymph nodes) colon cancer. Edrecolomab was well tolerated in these studies and as such research has now concentrated on whether it can be of any use in other forms of cancer.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-4030	AM-4030	10550598							"AM-4030 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It is a derivative of HU-210 which has been substituted with a 6Î²-(-3-hydroxyprop-1-enyl) group. This adds a ""southern"" aliphatic hydroxyl group to the molecule as seen in the CP-series of nonclassical cannabinoid drugs, and so AM-4030 represents a hybrid structure between the classical and nonclassical cannabinoid families, with the 6-hydroxyalkyl chain rigidified with a double bond with defined stereochemistry. This gives AM-4030 a greater degree of selectivity, so while it is still a potent agonist at both CB1 and CB2, it is reasonably selective for CB1, with a Ki of 0.7nM at CB1 and 8.6nM at CB2, a selectivity of around 12x. Resolution of the enantiomers of AM-4030 yields an even more potent compound, although with less selectivity, with the (-) enantiomer AM-4030a having a Ki of 0.6nM at CB1 and 1.1nM at CB2."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Polio_vaccine	Polio vaccine						Parenteral , Oral drops		Two polio vaccines are used throughout the world to combat poliomyelitis (or polio). The first was developed by Jonas Salk and first tested in 1952. Announced to the world by Salk on April 12, 1955, it consists of an injected dose of inactivated (dead) poliovirus. An oral vaccine was developed by Albert Sabin using attenuated poliovirus. Human trials of Sabin's vaccine began in 1957 and it was licensed in 1962. Because there is no long term carrier state for poliovirus in immunocompetent individuals, polioviruses have no non-primate reservoir in nature, and survival of the virus in the environment for an extended period of time appears to be remote. Therefore, interruption of person to person transmission of the virus by vaccination is the critical step in global polio eradication. The two vaccines have eradicated polio from most countries in the world, and reduced the worldwide incidence from an estimated 350,000 cases in 1988 to 1,652 cases in 2007.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desiccated_thyroid_extract	Desiccated thyroid extract						Oral		"Desiccated thyroid or thyroid extract, refers to porcine (or mixed beef and pork) thyroid glands, dried and powdered for therapeutic use. Pork (or mixed beef and pork) thyroid preparations were developed in the late 19th century, and are still used today to treat hypothyroidism, the condition of having an underactive thyroid gland. This product is sometimes referred to as ""natural thyroid"", ""natural thyroid hormones"", ""pork thyroid"", thyroid USP, thyroid BP, or by the name of a commercial brand, such as ""Armour Thyroid"" or ""Nature-Throid"" & ""Westhroid"". Desiccated thyroid has been described in the United States Pharmacopoeia for nearly a century as the cleaned, dried, and powdered thyroid gland previously deprived of connective tissue and fat... obtained from domesticated animals that are used for food by man (USP XVI). In the last few decades, pork alone is the usual source. Historically, before modern assays, the potency was specified only by iodine content (""not less than 0.17% and not more than 0.23%""), rather than hormonal content or activity. Brands include Forest Lab's Armour, and Naturethroid & Westhroid by RLC Labs. Also available is a new generic NP thyroid by Acella Pharmaceuticals. Canada's desiccated thyroid is made by Erfa and is called Thyroid. All consist of desiccated porcine thyroid powder, differing only in the binders and fillers. Nature-Throid and Westhroid are available in the following strengths: 1/4(16.25 mg), 1/2(32.5 mg), 3/4(48.75 mg), 1(65 mg), 1.25(81.25 mg), 1.5(97.5 mg), 1.75(113.75), 2(130 mg), 2.25(146.25 mg), 2.5(162.5 mg), 3(195 mg), 4(260 mg), & 5(325 mg) grain. Each one grain (65 mg) contains 9 mcg of T3, and 38 mcg of T4. All brands contain a mixture of thyroid hormones: T4, T3 in the proportions usually present in pig thyroids (approximately 80% T4 and 20% T3). Armour is made in the following strengths: 1/4, 1/2, 1, 2, and 3 grain as well as 4 and 5 grain tablets. One grain (about 60Â mg) of desiccated thyroid contains about 38 mcg of T4 and 9 mcg of T3.

Chemically, it is a synthetic congener of the naturally occurring drug hirudin (found in the saliva of the medicinal leech Hirudo medicinalis). Bivalirudin is a DTI that overcomes many limitations seen with indirect thrombin inhibitors, such as heparin. Bivalirudin is a short, synthetic peptide that is potent, highly specific, and a reversible inhibitor of thrombin. It inhibits both circulating and clot-bound thrombin, while also inhibiting thrombin-mediated platelet activation and aggregation. Bivalirudin has a quick onset of action and a short half-life. It does not bind to plasma proteins (other than thrombin) or to red blood cells. Therefore it has a predictable antithrombotic response. There is no risk for Heparin Induced Thrombocytopenia/Heparin Induced Thrombosis-Thrombocytopenia Syndrome (HIT/HITTS). It does not require a binding cofactor such as antithrombin and does not activate platelets. These characteristics make bivalirudin an ideal alternative to heparin. Bivalirudin clinical studies demonstrated consistent positive outcomes in patients with stable angina, unstable angina (UA), non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) undergoing PCI in 7 major randomized trials.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lisdexamfetamine	Lisdexamfetamine	11597698	DB01255	H645GUL8KJ	608137-32-2		Oral	Gastro-intestinal ; Hepatic after conversion to d-amphetamine	Lisdexamfetamine dimesylate (-lysine--amphetamine; sold as Vyvanse) is a psychostimulant prodrug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. Its molecular structure consists of dextroamphetamine coupled with the essential amino acid -lysine. Lisdexamfetamine itself is inactive and acts as a prodrug to dextroamphetamine upon cleavage of the lysine portion of the molecule. It was developed for the intention of creating a longer-lasting and more difficult to abuse version of dextroamphetamine, as the requirement of conversion into dextroamphetamine via enzymes in the red blood cells increases its duration, regardless of the route of ingestion. The drug lisdexamfetamine dimesylate is the first prodrug of its kind. Studies conducted show that lisdexamfetamine dimesylate may have less abuse potential than d-amphetamine, and an abuse profile similar to diethylpropion at dosages that are FDA approved for treatment for ADHD, but still high abuse potential when this dosage is exceeded by over 100%. There is no increased onset or effect as occurs with IV administration of dextroamphetamine compared to oral use of the same. Intravenously administered lisdexamfetamine produced likability effects similar to placebo, therefore affirming the drug's ability to reduce abuse potential. Lisdexamfetamine is indicated for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children six to twelve years and in adults as an integral part of a total treatment program that may include other measures (i.e. , psychological, educational, social). The safety and efficacy of lisdexamfetamine dimesylate in patients three to five years old have not been established. Important side effects of therapeutic lisdexamfetamine include stunted growth in young people and occasionally a psychosis can occur at therapeutic doses during chronic therapy as a treatment emergent side effect. When abused at high doses the risk of experiencing side effects and their severity increases. As opposed to Adderall, which contains roughly 75% dextroamphetamine and 25% levoamphetamine, lisdexamfetamine is a single-enantiomer amphetamine formula. This pure formulation may reduce side effects, but certain individuals exhibit a better clinical response to the mixed isomer preparation. Vyvanse is also being investigated for possible treatment of Major Depressive Disorder, cognitive impairment associated with Schizophrenia, Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, and Binge Eating Disorder.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levallorphan	Levallorphan	5359371	DB00504	353613BU4U	152-02-3		Oral		Levallorphan (Lorfan, Naloxiphan) is a drug of the morphinan family which is used as an opioid antidote or antagonist. It acts as an antagonist on Î¼-opioid receptor and agonist on kappa receptors hence called partial agonist, and as a result, blocks the effects of stronger agents with greater intrinsic activity such as morphine or endogenous Î²-endorphin. Levallorphan was formerly widely used in general anaesthesia, mainly to reverse the respiratory depression produced by the opioid analgesics and barbiturates which are used for induction of surgical anaesthesia, although it is now less common as the newer drug naloxone tends to be used instead. It was also used in combination with opioids to reduce their side effects, mainly in obstetrics, and when a very small dose of levallorphan is used alongside an opioid full agonist this can in fact produce greater analgesia than when the agonist is used by itself. The combination of levallorphan with pethidine (meperidine) was indeed used so frequently that a standardized formulation was made available, known as Pethilorfan.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenindamine	Phenindamine	11291	DB01619	772BQ8KSST	82-88-2				Phenindamine (Nolahist, Thephorin) is an antihistamine and anticholinergic closely related to cyproheptadine which is used to treat symptoms of the common cold and allergies, such as sneezing, itching, rashes, and hives. Its efficacy against some symptoms of opioid withdrawal was researched in the 1950s and 1960s in a number of countries; William S. Burroughs' book Junkie mentions this technique (although in this case he claims to intravenously administer this drug, as the brand Thephorin, to his wife Joan to alleviate her withdrawal from chronic & excessive use of amphetamine,which she obtained from then freely available Benzedrine inhalers). Like many other first-generation antihistamines, phenindamine has useful potentiating effects on many narcotic analgesics and is even more useful with those opioids which release histamine when in the body. Nolahist was originally manufactured in the USA by Carnrick Laboratories, and later by Amarin Pharmaceuticals. When that company ceased its American operations, its product line was acquired by Valeant, but they declined to resume manufacturing Nolahist.

It was discovered in by Hoffman-La Roche in 1957 during research into the related drug pethidine. Derivatives were tested to prove the theory that phenolic & non-phenolic opioids bind at different sites of the opiate receptor. Allylprodine is more potent as an analgesic (23 times morphine) than other similar drugs such as Î±-prodine, due to the allyl group binding to an additional amino acid target in the binding site on the Î¼-opioid receptor. It is also stereoselective, with one isomer being much more active. Allylprodine produces similar effects to other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal. 40px This analgesic-related article is a stub.

In the form of the diglumine salt it functions as a gadolinium-based MRI contrast medium, under the trade name gadobenate dimeglumine. BOPTA is a derivative of DTPA in which one terminal carboxyl group, â€“C(O)OH is replaced by -Câ€“Oâ€“CH2C6H5. Thus gadobenic acid is closely related to gadopentetic acid. BOPTA itself was first synthesized in 1995. In the ""gadobenate"" ion gadolinium ion is 9-coordinate with BOPTA acting as a 8-coordinating ligand. The ninth position is occupied by a water molecule, which exchanges rapidly with water molecules in the immediate vicinity of the strongly paramagnetic complex, providing a mechanism for MRI contrast enhancement.

Tenecteplase is a tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) produced by recombinant DNA technology using an established mammalian cell line. Tenecteplase is a 527 amino acid glycoprotein developed by introducing the following modifications to the complementary DNA (cDNA) for natural human tPA: a substitution of threonine 103 with asparagine, and a substitution of asparagine 117 with glutamine, both within the kringle 1 domain, and a tetra-alanine substitution at amino acids 296â€“299 in the protease domain. Tenecteplase is a recombinant fibrin-specific plasminogen activator that is derived from native t-PA by modifications at three sites of the protein structure. It binds to the fibrin component of the thrombus (blood clot) and selectively converts thrombus-bound plasminogen to plasmin, which degrades the fibrin matrix of the thrombus. Tenecteplase has a higher fibrin specificity and greater resistance to inactivation by its endogenous inhibitor (PAI-1) compared to native t-PA. Research Researchers at Newcastle University in Australia say they have had a significant breakthrough in treating stroke patients using the commonly used drug, with some people showing ""Lazarus-like"" recoveries. The findings published in the New England Medical Journal show, in some cases, stroke victims using Tenecteplase making almost miraculous recoveries within days. One of the study's authors, Dr Neil Spratt from John Hunter Hospital, says the drug is commonly used for heart treatment, but preliminary results show it also helps stroke victims. The three-year study was trialled on 75 patients. Dr Spratt says there were a number of patients who had ""Lazarus-like responses"" to the new drug, with some patients on their feet within an hour of taking it. ""People who came in really completely paralysed - one of my patients, a young woman, came in completely paralysed down one side of her body and unable to speak - and an hour after receiving the drug she essentially has normal strength and normal speech, and she's gone on to do fantastically well,"" he said. But Dr Spratt says more tests will need to be run before the drug is widely used in stroke patients, and adds, ""Even if the results [of a further trial] are only half as good as those from our smaller trial, I think it's likely to become licensed and become the new standard of care for stroke worldwide,"""

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flutoprazepam	Flutoprazepam	3400		2GHY1101MM	25967-29-7		Oral, Intravenous	Hepatic	Flutoprazepam (Restas) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine. It was patented in Japan by Sumitomo in 1972 and its medical use remains mostly confined to that country. Its muscle relaxant properties are approximately equivalent to those of diazepam - however, it has more powerful sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects and is around four times more potent by weight compared to diazepam. It is longer acting than diazepam due to its long-acting active metabolites, which contribute significantly to its effects. Flutoprazepam is typically used for the treatment of severe insomnia and may also be used for treating stomach ulcers. Abuse of benzodiazepines in Japan is extremely common, with flutoprazepam, nimetazepam, temazepam and triazolam being the four most often sought after by drug users. Triazolam and temazepam make-up 65% of all prescription forgeries for benzodiazepines, while flutoprazepam and nimetazepam make up all the rest of the cases of benzodiazepine prescription forgeries. Diazepam and oxazepam are also commonly misused due to the fact that they are easily obtainable by prescription from doctors. Flutoprazepam is currently a Schedule IV drug under the international Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971. In Singapore, flutoprazepam is a Class C-Schedule II drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act. In Thailand, flutoprazepam is a Schedule III psychotropic substance. In Hong Kong, flutoprazepam is regulated under Schedule 1 of Hong Kong's Chapter 134 Dangerous Drugs Ordinance. Flutoprazepam can only be used legally by health professionals and for university research purposes. The substance can be given by pharmacists under a prescription. Anyone who supplies the substance without prescription can be fined $10000 (HKD). The penalty for trafficking or manufacturing the substance is a $5,000,000 fine and life imprisonment. Possession of the substance for consumption without license from the Department of Health is illegal with a $1,000,000 (HKD) fine and/or 7 years of jail time.

It is currently under clinical development in an extended release form as an anxiolytic and antidepressant agent. Pharmacologically, gepirone acts as a selective 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist. Gepirone was originally developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb, but was out-licensed to Fabre-Kramer in 1993. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected approval for gepirone in 2004. It was submitted for the preregistration (NDA) phase again in May 2007 after adding additional information from clinical trials as the FDA required in 2004. However, in 2007 it once again failed to convince the FDA of its qualities for treating anxiety and depression. Fabre-Kramer and GlaxoSmithKline are evaluating the response from the FDA to determine appropriate next steps. Ormaza, V. A. ; 1986, ES 8606333Â .

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Indatraline	Indatraline	126280		4U40Y96J1Z	86939-10-8		Oral		Indatraline (Lu 19-005) is a non-selective monoamine transporter inhibitor that has been shown to block the reuptake of dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin with effects similar to those of cocaine. However, the effects have been shown to have slower onset and longer duration than cocaine, suggesting that the compound may, along with similar compounds, be used for treatment of cocaine addiction. Apparently, Lu 19-005 can be used to block the action of methamphetamine and MDMA. Compare Indatraline with tametraline since they are directly homologous. There are some differences though. Superposition should make it possible to see that there is at least a relationship between the pharmacophore of indatraline and various phenyltropanes.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Propiram	Propiram	26216		WT6247U6PX	15686-91-6		oral, injected		Propiram (Algeril, Dirame, Bay 4503) is a partial mu opioid receptor agonist and weak mu antagonist analgesic from the ampromide family of drugs. It was invented in 1963 in the United Kingdom by Bayer but was not widely marketed, although it saw some limited clinical use, especially in dentistry. A report in the reference Drug Facts & Comparisons, 56th (2002) Edition reports that research about the drug has increased in the past few years, having reached the (albeit restricted) Stage III clinical trial process in the United States and Canada. Propiram is currently a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance in the United States. It has been almost exclusively used as the fumarate salt, which has a free base conversion ratio of 0.70. Propiram exhibits weak opioid antagonist activity on the mu receptor -- quite a bit weaker than its agonist effects -- and the effect on kappa and delta opioid, sigma receptors, or the NMDA system are not well understood. Other drugs of the partial mu-opioid agonist/antagonist type include meptazinol, buprenorphine, butorphanol, phenazocine, nalbuphine, pentazocine, dezocine and its relatives. With about 10 per cent of the analgesic potency of morphine with 50 mg being equivalent to more than 60 mg of codeine or 50 mg of pentazocine in many patients, propiram is an effective analgesic comparable to other drugs such as these as well as pethidine, with a normal dose of around 50-100mg and a duration of action of 3 to 6 hours. It is more potent and effective than codeine, and longer lasting and with a faster onset of action compared to pethidine. Side effects include sedation, dizziness, nausea and vomiting. Propiram has been available in oral, rectal, and injectable formulations, with bioavailability above 97 per cent after oral administration. Many related compounds are known, although only propiram was ever commercialised.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Seletracetam	Seletracetam	9856063		RFR2CH3QZK	357336-74-4		Oral		Seletracetam (UCB 44212) is a pyrrolidone-derived drug of the racetam family that is structurally related to levetiracetam. It was under development by UCB Pharmaceuticals as a more potent and effective anticonvulsant drug to replace levetiracetam but its production has been halted. There are two main mechanisms of action for seletracetam. The first is its high-affinity stereospecific binding to synaptic vesicle glycoprotein 2A. Seletracetam has shown potent seizure suppression in models of acquired and genetic epilepsy, and has been well tolerated by various animal models. The second is its binding to N-type calcium channels and preventing influx of Ca during high-voltage activation that is typical of epilepsy. While similar in structure to nootropic drugs, it is not expected to have cognitive enhancing properties. Seletracetam was in Phase II clinical trials under the supervision of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) but its production is on hold.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulbutiamine	Sulbutiamine	71124		42NCM1BW43	3286-46-2		Oral		Sulbutiamine is a synthetic derivative of thiamine (vitamin B1). As a dimer of two modified thiamine molecules, it is a lipophilic compound that crosses the bloodâ€“brain barrier more readily than thiamine and increases the levels of thiamine and thiamine phosphate esters in the brain. Sulbutiamine was discovered in Japan in an effort to develop more useful thiamine derivatives since it was hoped that increasing the lipophilicity of thiamine would result in better pharmacokinetic properties. Although its clinical efficacy is uncertain, it is the only compound used to treat asthenia that is known to selectively target the areas that are involved in the condition. In addition to its use as a treatment for chronic fatigue, sulbutiamine may improve memory, reduce psycho-behavioural inhibition, and improve erectile dysfunction. At therapeutic dosages, it has few reported adverse effects, though in one patient with bipolar disorder they had poor attendance for psychotherapy, allegedly due to an addiction to the substance. It is available for over-the-counter sale as a nutritional supplement.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pilsicainide	Pilsicainide	4820		AV0X7V6CSE	88069-67-4		Oral, IV		Pilsicainide is an antiarrhythmic agent. It is marketed in Japan as ã‚µãƒ³ãƒªã‚ºãƒ  (Sunrythm). The JAN is pilsicainide hydrochloride. Pilsicainide is a drug used clinically in Japan to treat cardiac arrhythmias. It functions by blocking the fast inward movement of sodium ions through the Nav1.5 sodium channel that contributes to the rapid depolarization characteristic of phase 0 in the cardiac action potential. Pilsicainide is a pure sodium channel blocker, meaning it does not significantly affect any other cardiac channels including potassium and calcium channels. Pilsicainide binds to a common site on the sodium channel through either intracellular or extracellular application(3). The affinity of pilsicainide for the sodium channel receptor and its rate of binding are dependent on the state of the channel. It has been proven to have a greater affinity for the receptor in its inactivated state as opposed to resting or open(4), thereby following the modulated receptor hypothesis(5). Binding of pilsicainide selectively inhibits the channel(6), preventing the movement of sodium ions into the cardiac cell. This decreases the rate of depolarization of the cell membrane as well as the action potential amplitude, but has no effect on the overall duration of the action potential(6). Suppression of the depolarization rate is use-dependent(7), and therefore inhibition increases with increased stimulation. Pilsicainide also causes delayed impulse conduction through the myocardium in a dose-dependent manner(8). The effects of pilsicainide have a slow rate of onset and offset resulting in a prolonged recovery time(9). This contributes to its potent blocking activity and its classification as a class 1c antiarrhythmic agent(10). A cardiac arrhythmia includes any abnormal heartbeat and can be manifested as tachycardia, bradycardia, or other irregular rhythms. Pilsicainide has been proven successful in treating both ventricular(11) and supraventricular arrhythmias with few adverse effects(12). It is especially effective in the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Atrial fibrillation is the most common type of arrhythmia(14). It may result from various heart abnormalities or may occur spontaneously in a seemingly healthy individual(15). Atrial fibrillation is characterized by rapid, disorganized electrical impulses in the atria resulting in depolarization of only a small group of myocardial cells. This prevents the atria from undergoing coordinated contraction, instead resulting in small fibrillations of the heart muscle. Re-entry occurs when an impulse does not die after activating the heart but instead returns to the atria and causes re-excitation(16). Simultaneous re-entry of multiple impulses with short wavelengths results in atrial fibrillation(17). Impulse wavelength is the product of the conduction velocity and the effective refractory period. Pilsicainide suppresses atrial conduction velocity but also increases the effective refractory period(18). Its effects on the refractory period are significantly more substantial, and therefore pilsicainide treatment results in an increased wavelength and termination of atrial fibrillation. A single oral dose of pilsicainide effectively restores normal sinus rhythm in patients with recent-onset atrial fibrillation and a healthy left ventricle. Long-term therapy with pilsicainide is successful in treating chronic atrial fibrillation). 3. Hattori Y, and Inomata N.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Candocuronium_iodide	Candocuronium iodide	71537		SC80GNP08C	54278-85-2		IV		Candocuronium iodide (formerly recognized as chandonium or HS-310) is the prototypical azasteroidal neuromuscular-blocking drug or skeletal muscle relaxant in the category of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs. Its potential adjunctive use in anesthesia to facilitate endotracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation was briefly evaluated in clinical studies in India, but further development was discontinued because of attendant undesirable cardiovasular effects, primarily tachycardia that was no worse than but also not an improvement over the clinically established pancuronium. Chandonium demonstrated a short duration and a rapid onset of action, with little or no ganglion blocking activity, and it was only slightly less potent than pancuronium bromide. As noted with other well established neuromuscular blocking agents, chandonium preferentially antagonizes competitively the nicotinic subtype of acetycholine receptors. The agent was developed by researchers in the laboratories of Harkishan Singh at the Panjab University in Chandigarh, India, as part of the ongoing search for the Holy Grail of neuromuscular blocking agents: a non-depolarizing replacement for the most popular clinically used depolarizing agent, succinylcholine. The mono- and bis-quaternary azasteroid series of compounds (to which chandonium belongs) stems from the same principle that led to the invention of aminosteroids such as pancuronium, vecuronium and rocuronium: the use of the steroid skeleton to provide a somewhat rigid distance between the two quaternary ammoniumm centers with appendages incorporating fragments of choline or acetylcholine. The discovery program, initiated by Singh, initially led to the synthesis of a bis-quaternary non-depolarizing agent labelled HS-342 (4,17a-dimethyl-4,17a-diaza-D-homo-5Î±-androstane dimethiodide) that was equipotent with tubocurarine and with one-third its duration of action but not suitable for further clinical evaluation. Modifications around the structure of HS-342 led to two other notable agents, HS-347 and HS-310 (subsequently named chandonium). HS-347 was equipotent with tubocurarine but also exhibited considerable ganglion blocking activity, whereas chandonium appeared to be suitably placed for clinical trials following encouraging preclinical evaluations. As already noted, chandonium still did not provide the desirable profile and a further extension of research was undertaken to overcome the limitations of chandonium. This led to four more promising compounds, HS-692, HS-693, HS-704 and HS-705. The onset and duration of these four agents were indinguishable from those of chandonium, but, unfortunately, all demonstrated profound vagolytic effects and much weaker potencies than those of chandonium. To improve on the potency, further modifications of the chandonium nucleus were undertaken, leading to the identification of yet another promising compound, HS-626. Unfortunately, upon further preclinical evaluations in the cat and isolated preparations, it was clearly evident that, although HS-626 demonstrated a slightly more desirable neuromuscular blocking profile than that of chandonium, the overall degree of improvement was insufficient to warrant advancement to clinical testing. Overall, Singh's research group discovered and identified chandonium which spawned numerous related neuromuscular blocking agents with short durations of action but also attendant with undesirable cardiovascular effects. Subsequent further attempts to attain the intended goal led the group to explore other modifications at the 3 and 16 positions of the androstane nucleus, but the admirable undaunted persistence has not yet yielded an agent worthy of expanded evaluation to clinical testing in this azasteroidal class of neuromuscular blocking agents.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metapramine	Metapramine	65700		303954M7YF	21730-16-5		Oral		Metapramine (trade names Prodastene, Timaxel) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) developed by Rhone Poulenc that was introduced for the treatment of depression in France in 1984. In addition to its efficacy against affective disorders, it also has analgesic properties, and may be useful in the treatment of pain. Metapramine has desipramine-like effects, acting as a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor without affecting the reuptake of serotonin or dopamine. It has also been shown to act as a low-affinity NMDA receptor antagonist. Metapramine's direct effects on serotonin, histamine, and muscarinic acetylcholine receptors have not been assayed, but uniquely among most TCAs, it has anecdotally been reported to lack anticholinergic effects.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxpheneridine	Oxpheneridine	56863		5OO7RKH9WL	546-32-7				"Oxpheneridine (Carbamethidine) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is related to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine). Oxpheneridine is not currently used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as analgesia, sedation, nausea and respiratory depression. Unlike most opioid derivatives, oxpheneridine is not specifically listed as an illegal drug. In the UNODC narcotics report of 1958, they state that it was not possible to administer oxpheneridine in high doses as it is poorly soluble and highly irritating, and at the low doses administered it did not produce addiction in animals. This appears to be the only time oxpheneridine has been investigated, and so its pharmacological properties have not been well established. Oxpheneridine would probably be regarded as a controlled substance analogue of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand. In Canada, Oxpheneridine is specifically excluded from the illegal drugs list on the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act schedules, presumably on the basis of the lack of addictive potential found by the UNODC. Canada also lists ""Carbamethidine"" as another excluded drug on its schedule, but this appears to be a double entry as the chemical name listed for carbamethidine is actually the chemical name of oxpheneridine, and the chemical name given for oxpheneridine on the Canadian drug schedules is chemically incorrect and does not correspond to a compound that could exist."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pentamorphone	Pentamorphone	5464186		MM4487B4MW	68616-83-1				Pentamorphone (14Î²-pentylaminomorphinone, RX-77989) is a semi-synthetic opiate derivative related to compounds such as morphine, hydromorphone and oxymorphone. Developed in 1984, it is a potent opioid analgesic several times stronger than fentanyl, and with a similarly fast onset of effects and short duration of action. It was found to produce relatively little respiratory depression compared to other potent opioid agonists, but its analgesic effects were somewhat disappointing in human trials, and while pentamorphone had some slight advantages over fentanyl these were not sufficient to warrant its introduction into clinical use.

It is not currently used in medicine, but has similar side-effects to other opiates, which include itching, nausea and respiratory depression. Phenomorphan is a highly potent drug due to the N-phenethyl group, which boosts affinity to the Î¼-opioid receptor, and so phenomorphan is around 10x more potent than levorphanol, which is itself 6-8x the potency of morphine. Other analogues where the N-(2-phenylethyl) group has been replaced by other aromatic rings. are even more potent, with the N-(2-ethyl) and the N-(2-ethyl) analogues being 60x and 45x stronger than levorphanol, respectively.

It is the esterification product of the enol tautomer of hydrocodone (dihydrocodeineone) with acetic acid. Dihydrocodeinone enol acetate's analgesic and antitussive potency is slightly higher than that of its parent compound hydrocodone. Like all of its chemical relatives in this therapeutic class (codeine-based narcotic antitussives and midrange analgesics), Dihydrocodeinone enol acetate exerts its effect as a prodrug for stronger opioids, namely hydromorphone, which is formed in the liver by the Cytochrome P450 2D6 enzyme pathway. As a result, the effectiveness of a given dose of thebacon will vary amongst patients and some food and drugs can affect the metabolism and therefore the potency of thebacon. Dihydrocodeinone enol acetate is a Schedule I controlled substance in the US.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trimeperidine	Trimeperidine	6148		1M2IB31DTS	64-39-1				Trimeperidine is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of prodine. It was developed in or around 1954 in the USSR during research into the related drug pethidine. Trimeperidine has four structural isomers, of which two are active, the Î³ isomer trimeperidine, and the Î² isomer isopromedol. It is around half the potency of morphine as an analgesic, and has been widely used for the treatment of pain. Trimeperidine produces similar effects to other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xibornol	Xibornol	11777299		RQ12GMY0FZ	13741-18-9				Xibornol is an antibiotic. It is primarily administered to the throat. Xibornol is a lipophilic drug mainly used in Italy and Spain in spray dosage forms for the local treatment of infection and inflammation of the throat. Its poor water solubility makes difficult the development of aqueous formulations of the drug, thus giving rise to a limited number of stable and pharmaceutically accepted preparations. In fact, xibornol is actually marketed only as spray aqueous suspension. The aim of this work was to evaluate the possibility of developing a stable liquid formulation of the drug intended for oral spray administration using a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS). These systems are able to adequately improve the drug solubility, allowing the introduction of relatively high concentration of drugs in the form of solution. Labrafil M1944, Labrafil M2125 and Labrafac CC were screened as oil phases, Labrasol and Labrafac PG as surfactants and Transcutol as co-surfactant. Pseudo-ternary phase diagrams were constructed, by titration with the aqueous phase of different oil phases and surfactant/co-surfactant mixtures in order to identify the self-microemulsification region and the optimal micro-emulsion composition. Then, complete pharmaceutical formulations were prepared and evaluated for stability and viscosity properties. The final selected formulations, containing Labrafil M1944, Transcutol, Labrafac PG and a hydrophilic co-solvent (propylene glycol or PEG 200) allowed complete solubilization of the required xibornol concentration (3%, w/v) and showed physical good stability up to 2 months at 25 and 4 Â°C, suitable viscosity and organoleptic properties.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brifentanil	Brifentanil	60672		6GDT77PQBW	101345-71-5				Brifentanil (A-3331) is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of fentanyl and was developed in the early 1990s. Brifentanil is most similar to highly potent, short-acting fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil. The effects of brifentanil are very similar to those of alfentanil, with strong but short lasting analgesia and sedation, and particularly notable itching and respiratory depression. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl, and include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. The risk of respiratory depression is especially high with potent fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil and brifentanil, and these drugs pose a significant risk of death if used outside of a hospital setting with appropriate artificial breathing apparatus available.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cetilistat	Cetilistat	9952916		LC5G1JUA39	282526-98-1				Cetilistat is a drug designed to treat obesity. It acts in the same way as the older drug orlistat (Xenical) by inhibiting pancreatic lipase, an enzyme that breaks down triglycerides in the intestine. Without this enzyme, triglycerides from the diet are prevented from being hydrolyzed into absorbable free fatty acids and are excreted undigested. In human trials, cetilistat was shown to produce similar weight loss to orlistat, but also produced similar side effects such as oily, loose stools, fecal incontinence, frequent bowel movements, and flatulence. It is likely that the same precautions would apply in that absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and other fat-soluble nutrients may be inhibited, requiring vitamin supplements to be used to avoid deficiencies. Cetilistat has completed Phase 1 and 2 trials in the West and is currently in Phase 3 trials in Japan where it is partnered with Takeda. Norgina BV has now acquired the full global rights to cetilistat from Alizyme after the latter went into administration.

It has similar effects to morphine such as sedation, analgesia and respiratory depression, but is more potent and has a steeper dose-response curve and longer half-life. It is used in medicine as the bitartrate salt (free base conversion ratio 0.643, molecular weight 471.5) and hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.770, molecular weight 393.9) Hydromorphinol was developed in Austria in 1932. It is available, and commonly used, as a medicine in Sweden; in the United States, it was never available and is classified as a Schedule I drug. Hydromorphinol is metabolised mainly in the liver in the same fashion as many other opioids and is itself a minor active metabolite of 14-Hydroxydihydrocodeine, an uncommonly-used opiate (but is also therefore an active metabolite too of a first order active metabolite of oxycodone). It is distributed under the trade name Numorphan in some countries, whereas this trade name is used for oxymorphone much more commonly. It is controlled under the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lonidamine	Lonidamine	39562		U78804BIDR	50264-69-2				Lonidamine is a derivative of indazole-3-carboxylic acid, which for a long time, has been known to inhibit aerobic glycolysis in cancer cells. It seems to enhance aerobic glycolysis in normal cells, but suppress glycolysis in cancer cells. This is most likely through the inhibition of the mitochondrially bound hexokinase. Later studies in Ehrlich ascites tumor cells showed that lonidamine inhibits both respiration and glycolysis leading to a decrease in cellular ATP. Clinical trials of lonidamine in combination with other anticancer agents for a variety of cancers has begun. This is due to its proven ability to inhibit energy metabolism in cancer cells, and to enhance the activity of anticancer agents. Lonidamine has been used in the treatment of brain tumours in combination with radiotherapy and temozolomide. Results showed that a combination of temozolomide and lonidamine at clinically achievable, low plasma concentrations, could inhibit tumour growth, and lonidamine could reduce the dose of temozolomide required for radiosensitization of brain tumours. A drivitive of lanidamine, gamendazole, is in testing as a possible male contraceptive pill.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Maribavir	Maribavir	471161		PTB4X93HE1	176161-24-3				Maribavir (originally named 1263W94) is an experimental oral antiviral drug candidate licensed by ViroPharma from GlaxoSmithKline in 2003 for the prevention and treatment of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) disease in hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplant patients. The mechanism by which maribavir inhibits HCMV replication is by inhibition of an HCMV encoded protein kinase enzyme called UL97 or pUL97. Maribavir showed promise in Phase II clinical trials and was granted fast track status, but failed to meet study goals in a Phase III trial. However, the dosage used in the Phase III trial may have been too low to be efficacious. A Phase II study with maribavir demonstrated that prophylaxis with maribavir displayed strong antiviral activity, as measured by statistically significant reduction in the rate of reactivation of CMV in recipients of hematopoietic stem cell/bone marrow transplants. In an intent-to-treat analysis of the first 100 days after the transplant, the number of subjects who required pre-emptive anti-CMV therapy was statistically significantly reduced with maribavir compared to placebo. ViroPharma conducted a Phase III clinical study to evaluate the prophylactic use for the prevention of cytomegalovirus disease in recipients of allogeneic stem cell transplant patients. In February 2009, ViroPharma announced that the Phase III study failed to achieve its goal, showing no significant difference between maribavir and a placebo at reducing the rate at which CMV DNA levels were detected in patients.

It was legally sold as a prohormone in the United States until 2005, when it was reclassified as a Schedule III drug. A 2006 study determined that 1-testosterone has a high androgenic and anabolic potency even without being metabolized, so it can be characterized as a typical anabolic steroid. 1-Testosterone binds highly selective to the androgen receptor (AR) and has a high potency to stimulate AR dependent transactivation. In vivo, an equimolar dose of 1-testosterone has the same potency to stimulate the growth of the prostate, the seminal vesicles and the androgen sensitive levator ani muscle as the reference AAS testosterone propionate, but unlike it, 1-testosterone also increases liver weight. Doping with 1-testosterone can be detected in urine samples using gas chromatography. A prodrug of 1-testosterone is 5Î±-androst-1-ene-3,17-dione, which may be synthesized from stanolone acetate.

It is sold under the brand name Duphaston, which is manufactured by Abbott. Dydrogesterone was first introduced to the market in 1961, and is currently approved in over 100 countries worldwide. It has an estimated cumulative exposure of more than 10 million pregnancies. Dydrogesterone is a potent, orally active progestogen indicated in a wide variety of gynaecological conditions related to progesterone deficiency. Although similar in molecular structure and pharmacological effects to endogenous progesterone. It is orally active at far lower doses. Its freedom from estrogenic, androgenic, anabolic, corticoid and other undesirable hormonal effects gives it additional benefits over most other synthetic progestogens. The therapeutic use of dydrogesterone is closely related to its physiological action on the neuro-endocrine control of ovarian function, as well as on the endometrium. As such, it is indicated in all cases of relative or absolute endogeneous progesterone deficiency. Dydrogesterone is to be withdrawn from the UK market from March 2008 for commercial reasons. Dydrogesterone was licensed for use in several indications,including threatened or recurrent miscarriage, dysfunctional uterine bleeding, and hormone replacement therapy. Dydrogesterone has proven effective in the following conditions associated with progesterone deficiency: menstrual disorders infertility due to luteal insufficiency threatened and habitual abortion. Dydrogesterone is not approved for this indication by any regulatory body in US, Canada or Australia. endometriosis premenstrual syndrome Dydrogesterone has also been registered as hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to counteract the negative effects of unopposed estrogen on the endometrium in women with an intact uterus. Dydrogesterone is relatively safe and well tolerated, and does not exhibit the androgenic side effects that are common with some other progestins, like medroxyprogesterone.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benzylmorphine	Benzylmorphine	5362507	DB01573		14297-87-1				Benzylmorphine (Peronine) is a semi-synthetic opiate narcotic introduced to the international market in 1896 and that of the United States very shortly thereafter. It is much like codeine, containing a benzyl group attached to the morphine molecule just as the methyl group creates codeine and the ethyl group creates ethylmorphine or dionine (used as a generic name for that drug just as peronine is for benzylmorphine). It is about 90 per cent as strong as codeine by weight. Benzylmorphine is used in much the same way as codeine and ethylmorphine, primarily as a moderate strength analgesic, for eye surgery as a 1 to 2 per cent solution, and as a cough suppressant. It was available in the United States prior to 1914 and was still used until the 1960s, but fell into disuse once alternative opiate derivatives became preferred by doctors (i.e. hydrocodone as an analgesic and codeine as a cough suppressant) Benzylmorphine is now a Schedule I Controlled Substance in the USA and is regulated internationally under UN drug conventions. Benzylmorphine is an active metabolite of the opioid analgesic myrophine, formed in the liver. It has a metabolic fate similar to that of codeine. Benzylmorphine is used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.91) and methylsulphonate(0.80) and has a US DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number of 9052.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/BMS-564,929	BMS-564,929	9882972	DB07286						BMS-564,929 is an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator, which is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for treatment of the symptoms of age-related decline in androgen levels in men. These symptoms may include depression, loss of muscle mass and strength, reduction in libido and osteoporosis. Treatment with exogenous testosterone is effective in counteracting these symptoms but is associated with a range of side effects, the most serious of which is enlargement of the prostate gland, which can lead to benign prostatic hypertrophy and even prostate cancer. This means there is a clinical need for selective androgen receptor modulators, which produce anabolic effects in some tissues such as muscle and bone, but without stimulating androgen receptors in the prostate. BMS-564,929 is one such compound currently in early human clinical trials, which is an orally active, potent and selective agonist for androgen receptors (Ki 2.1nM, 20x functional selectivity for muscle tissue over prostate) and in studies on castrated rats it was shown to counteract decrease in muscle mass over time, and at higher doses even increased muscle mass, without significantly affecting prostate tissue. It does however vastly reduce luteinizing hormone levels, it being an astonishing 33x more suppressive compound than testosterone, which may be a problem in human clinical use. Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids but with significantly less side effects. For this reason, SARMs have already been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency since January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs are currently being developed.

This metabolite is considerably more potent as a Î¼ opioid agonist than the parent compound. Tramadol is demethylated by the liver enzyme CYP2D6 in the same way as codeine, and so similarly to the variation in effects seen with codeine, individuals who have a less active form of CYP2D6 (""poor metabolisers"") will tend to get reduced analgesic effects from tramadol. The two enantiomers of O-desmethyltramadol show quite distinct pharmacological profiles; both (+) and (-)-O-desmethyltramadol are inactive as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, but (-)-O-desmethyltramadol retains activity as a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor and so the mix of both the parent compound and metabolites produced contributes significantly to the complex pharmacological profile of tramadol."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Propylamphetamine	Propylamphetamine	103544			51799-32-7			Hepatic	Propylamphetamine is a psychoactive drug and research chemical of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes which acts as a stimulant. It was first developed in the 1970s, mainly for research into the metabolism of, and as a comparison tool to, other amphetamines. A study in rats found propylamphetamine to be 1/4 as potent and active as amphetamine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Icariin	Icariin	5318997			489-32-7		Oral		Icariin is a flavonol, a type of flavonoid. It is the prenyl acetylation of kaempferide 3,7-O-diglucoside. The compound is derived from several species of plants in the Epimedium family, which are commonly known as Horny Goat Weed or Yin Yang Huo. Extracts from these plants are reputed to produce aphrodisiac effects, and are commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine to enhance erectile function, as well as for several other indications. It is thought that icariin is likely to be the primary active component of Epimedium extracts, as it has been shown to share several mechanisms of action with compounds used in Western medicine to treat impotence and improve sexual function. In particular, icariin has been demonstrated to act as a PDE5 inhibitor and to enhance the production of bioactive nitric oxide, as well as mimicking the effects of testosterone. It also shows antioxidant, antidepressant and neuroprotective effects in animal studies, as well as stimulating osteoblast activity in bone tissue which has been linked to a possible therapeutic role in the treatment of osteoporosis.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-APDB	5-APDB	192601			152623-94-4		Oral		5-(2-Aminopropyl)-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran (5-APDB, 3-Desoxy-MDA, EMA-4) is a putative entactogen drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine classes. It is an analogue of the MDA where the heterocyclic 3-position oxygen from the 3,4-methylenedioxy ring has been replaced by a methylene bridge. 6-APDB is an anlogue of 5-APDB where the 4-position oxygen has been replaced by a methylene bridge instead. 5-APDB was developed by a team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University as part of their research into non-neurotoxic analogues of MDMA. In animal studies, 5-APDB's effects generalize most closely to non-stimulant MDMA analogues such as MBDB and MMAI, while producing no substitution for LSD or amphetamine. In vitro studies show that 5-APDB acts as a highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA), with IC50 values of 130 nM, 7,089 nM, and 3,238 nM for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, respectively. In contrast, 6-APDB is more balanced on the three monoamine neurotransmitters and acts more similarly to MDA and MDMA. Anecdotal reports from human users suggest that 5-APDB produces mild empathy but with relatively little euphoria and is accompanied by sedation. Methoxy-substituted analogues of 5-APDB and 6-APDB have also been made and substituted for DOM in animal tests, although they were around 10x less potent than DOM.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/MMDA-2	MMDA-2	90966			23693-18-7		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rectum		MMDA-2 (2-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine) is a psychedelic drug of the amphetamine class. It is closely related to MMDA and MDA. Alexander Shulgin was likely the first to synthesize MMDA-2. In his book PiHKAL, the dose is listed as 25â€“50Â mg, and the duration is listed as 8â€“12 hours. Shulgin reports that MMDA-2 produces effects such as enhanced awareness, empathy, and visual facilitation and distortion, as well as some side effects like gastrointestinal upset and appetite loss. He states that 30Â mg is very similar to 80Â mg of MDA, and also remarks that it would be impossible for anyone to have a bad experience on the drug at that dose. Scientific research has shown that MMDA-2, unlike MMDA, but similarly to 6-methyl-MDA, is only very weak at inducing the release of serotonin or dopamine, and accordingly, does not produce amphetamine-appropriate responding in animals in drug discrimination studies. Instead, MMDA-2 is likely to act as a pure 5-HT2 receptor agonist similarly to the DOx series of compounds, with activation of the 5-HT2A receptor conferring its psychedelic effects. MMDA-2 has been sold as a designer drug in Japan.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicocodeine	Nicocodeine	5463872			3688-66-2		Oral, intravenous		Nicocodeine (Lyopect, Tusscodin) is an opiate derivative, closely related to dihydrocodeine and the codeine analogue of nicomorphine developed as a cough suppressant and analgesic. It is not commonly used in most countries, but has activity similar to other opiates. Nicocodeine and nicomorphine were introduced in the late 1950s by Lannacher Heilmittel of Austria. Nicocodeine is metabolised in the liver by demethylation to produce nicomorphine, also known as 6-nicotinoylmorphine, and subsequently further metabolised to morphine. Side effects are similar to those of other opiates and include itching, nausea and respiratory depression. Nicocodeine is regulated in most cases as is codeine and similar weak opiate drugs like ethylmorphine, benzylmorphine, dihydrocodeine and its other close derivatives like acetyldihydrocodeine (although not the stronger hydrocodone or oxycodone, which are regulated like morphine) and others of this class in the laws of countries and the Single Convention On Narcotic Drugs. One notable example is the fact that nicocodeine is a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance in the United States along with heroin as nicocodeine was never introduced for medical use in the United States. Nicodicodeine is a similar drug which is to nicocodeine as codeine is to dihydrocodeine. The metabolites of nicodicodeine include dihydromorphine where nicocodeine is turned into morphine as noted above. Nicocodeine cough medicines are available as syrups, extended-release syrups, and sublingual drops. Analgesic preparations are also in the form of sublingial drops and tablets for oral administration. Nicocodeine is approximately the same strength as hydrocodone.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Norpethidine	Norpethidine	32414			77-17-8		N/A		Norpethidine (Normeperidine, Pethidine Intermediate B) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is both a metabolite of and a precursor to pethidine (meperidine). Norpethidine is a controlled drug because of its potential uses in manufacturing both pethidine itself and a range of N-substituted derivatives, but it has little opioid activity in its own right. Instead, norpethidine acts as a stimulant and causes convulsions. Build up of norpethidine is a major complication when pethidine is used in medicine as an analgesic, as when pethidine is used in high doses or administered by intravenous infusion, norpethidine can accumulate in the body at a faster rate than it is being excreted, particularly in elderly patients or those with compromised liver or kidney function, resulting in a range of toxic effects, mainly convulsions, but also myoclonus and hyponatremia. These complications can be serious and have sometimes resulted in death. Metabolism of pethidine to norpethidine is carried out mainly by the CYP enzymes, CYP2B6, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4, in the liver, and since the activity of these enzymes can vary between individuals and can be influenced by concurrent use of other drugs, the rate and extent of norpethidine production can be difficult to predict.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxytocin/ergometrine	Oxytocin/ergometrine	11979741			37209-62-4		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intramuscular_injection		Oxytocin/ergometrine (trade name Syntometrine) is an obstetric combination drug. The components are synthetically produced oxytocin, a human hormone produced in the hypothalamus, and ergometrine, an alpha-adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonin (5-HT2) receptor agonist. Both substances cause the uterus to contract. An injection of syntometrine is given in the third stage of labor, just after the birth of the child, to facilitate delivery of the placenta and to prevent postpartum hemorrhage by causing smooth muscle tissue in the blood vessel walls to narrow, thereby reducing blood flow.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pethidine_intermediate_A	Pethidine intermediate A	62513			3627-62-1		N/A		Pethidine intermediate A is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is a precursor to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine). It is not known to have any analgesic activity in its own right, however other derivatives of pethidine with a 4-cyano group in place of the carboxylate ethyl ester have been found to be active, so pethidine intermediate A might also show opioid effects.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Protodioscin	Protodioscin	441891			55056-80-9		Oral		Protodioscin is a steroidal saponin compound found in a number of plant species, most notably in the Tribulus, Trigonella and Dioscorea families. It is best known as the putative active component of the herbal aphrodisiac plant Tribulus terrestris. Extracts from T. terrestris standardised for protodioscin content have been demonstrated to produce proerectile effects in isolated tissues and aphrodisiac action in several animal species. The mechanism for these effects has not been clearly established, and while protodioscin has been demonstrated to trigger release of nitric oxide in corpus cavernosum tissue, and also to produce statistically significant increases in the levels of the hormones testosterone, dihydrotestosterone and dehydroepiandrosterone in animal studies, but studies in humans have failed to show efficacy and its use remains controversial.

It is a stereoisomer of yohimbine. Rauwolscine is a central nervous system stimulant, a local anesthetic and a vague aphrodisiac. Rauwolscine acts predominantly as a Î±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist. It has also been shown to function as a 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist and 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor antagonist.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vinyl_ether	Vinyl ether	8024			109-93-3		inhalation		Vinyl ether, also known as divinyl ether, divinyl oxide, Vinethene (pharmaceutical trade name) and ethenoxyethene, is a clear, nearly colorless, volatile liquid which was briefly used as an inhalation anesthetic. It can be cyclopolymerized by itself and serves as a cross-linker in copolymerizations. Much to the dismay of some pharmacologists, the synthesis and isolation of pure vinyl ether proved to be a difficult challenge for chemists; vinyl ether was suspected to be a nearly ideal anesthetic as its structure was the combination of an alkene and an ether. In practice, vinyl ether proved to have favorable properties that allowed its brief usage as an anesthetic; on the other hand, it left many unimpressed. Aggravated by the issue of potentially toxic degradation over long-term storage and possible hepatic toxicity, vinyl ether began to leave the operating theater. Today, vinyl ether is a relic in the field of anesthesiology; however, the analytical techniques used to study its pharmacology laid the groundwork for the testing of new anesthetic agents.

It acts as a moderately potent and selective agonist for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors, but unlike the corresponding benzocyclobutene derivative TCB-2 which is considerably more potent than the parent compound 2C-B, 2CB-Ind is several times weaker, with racemic 2CB-Ind having a Ki of 47nM at the human 5-HT2A receptor, only slightly more potent than the mescaline analogue (R)-jimscaline.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/6-Monoacetylcodeine	6-Monoacetylcodeine	5745725			6703-27-1		Intravenous		6-Monoacetylcodeine (6-MAC) is an acetate ester of codeine in which the hydroxyl group on the 6 position has been acetylated. It is occasionally present as an impurity in street heroin and is typically created when attempting to create heroin from a solution of morphine in which some of the codeine from the original opium solution still remains. It is formed either through the addition of acetic anhydride, which will only acetylate the 6 position on the codeine or as a result of the addition of acetic acid with a catalyst in an attempt to create 6-monoacetylmorphine, the equivalent ester of morphine which is slightly more potent than heroin itself. 6-monoacetylcodeine is eventually metabolised into codeine and then into morphine. Since only illegally produced heroin is likely to contain 6-MAC, testing for the presence of it in the urine can be used as a fairly reliable method of detecting the use of illicit heroin, as opposed to prescription painkillers.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gamma-Amino-beta-hydroxybutyric_acid	Gamma-Amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid	2149			352-21-6				gamma-Amino-beta-hydroxybutyric acid (GABOB), also known as gamibetal or buxamin, is a derivative of the neurotransmitter GABA. It is found naturally in the human body but it is not known whether it has an important physiological role at normal concentrations. GABOB has anticonvulsant properties, but is of relatively low potency when used by itself, and is more useful as an adjuvant treatment used alongside another anticonvulsant drug. It has two stereoisomers, with the (3S) isomer d-GABOB being around twice as potent an anticonvulsant as the (3R) isomer l-GABOB. Other studies have suggested it may produce improved learning and memory function, probably through a cholinergic mechanism, as well as boosting growth hormone release. However its effectiveness for these purposes has not been well established and it is not widely used in medicine, although it is sold as a dietary supplement.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/IDRA-21	IDRA-21	3688			22503-72-6				IDRA-21 is an ampakine drug derived from aniracetam. IDRA-21 is a chiral molecule, with (+)-IDRA-21 being the active form. IDRA-21 shows nootropic effects in animal studies, significantly improving learning and memory. It is around 10-30x more potent than aniracetam in reversing cognitive deficits induced by alprazolam or scopolamine, and produces sustained effects lasting for up to three days after a single dose. The mechanism for this action is thought to be through promoting the induction of long-term potentiation between synapses in the brain. IDRA-21 does not produce neurotoxicity under normal conditions, although it may worsen neuronal damage following global ischemia after stroke or seizures. In comparison to the benzoylpiperidine derived ampakine drugs, IDRA-21 was more potent than CX-516, but less potent than CX-546. Newer benzothiadiazide derivatives with greatly increased potency compared to IDRA-21 have been developed, but these have not been researched to the same extent, with the benzoylpiperidine and benzoylpyrrolidine CX- series of drugs being favoured for clinical development, most likely due to more favourable toxicity profiles at high doses.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-015	JWH-015	4273754			155471-08-2				JWH-015 is a chemical from the naphthoylindole family that acts as a subtype-selective cannabinoid agonist. Its affinity for CB2 receptors is 13.8nM, while its affinity for CB1 is 383nM, meaning that it binds almost 28x more strongly to CB2 than CB1. However it still displays some CB1 activity, and in some model systems can be very potent and efficacious at activating CB1 receptors, and therefore it is not as selective as newer drugs such as JWH-133. It has been shown to possess immunomodulatory effects, and CB2 agonists may be useful in the treatment of pain and inflammation. It was discovered and named after Dr. John W. Huffman.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-030	JWH-030	9971539			162934-73-8				JWH-030 is a research chemical which is a cannabinoid receptor agonist.

With a Ki of 1.2nM it is fairly selective for the CB1 subtype, its affinity at this subtype approximately 10x the affinity at CB2. It was discovered by and named after Dr. John W. Huffman.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-200	JWH-200	10045570			103610-04-4				JWH-200 (WIN 55,225) is an analgesic chemical from the aminoalkylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid receptor agonist. Its binding affinity at the CB1 receptor is 42nM, around the same as that of THC, but its analgesic potency in vivo was higher than that of other analogues with stronger CB1 binding affinity in vitro, around 3 times that of THC but with less sedative effect, most likely reflecting favourable pharmacokinetic characteristics. It was discovered by, and named after, Dr. John W. Huffman. On March 1, 2011, the United States DEA temporarily placed JWH-200 under Schedule I of the Controlled Substances Act (along with four other synthetic cannabinoids), where it will remain for 12 months while it is researched and considered for permanent scheduling. In Canada, the drug is legal and not controlled (as of June 26, 2011).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/LR-5182	LR-5182	6328354			62373-97-1				LR-5182 is a stimulant drug which acts as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor, structurally related to the better known drug fencamfamine. It was developed by the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly in the 1970s, and researched for potential use as an antidepressant, although never marketed. LR-5182 has two stereoisomers, both of which are active, although one isomer blocks reuptake of only dopamine and noradrenaline, while the other blocks reuptake of serotonin as well. While LR-5182 itself never proceeded beyond initial animal studies, discovery of monoamine reuptake inhibition activity and stimulant effects in drugs of this type has subsequently led to the development of many other stimulant drugs of related chemical structure, primarily developed as potential antidepressants, or as substitute drugs for the treatment of cocaine abuse.

It acts as an irreversible acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, the same mechanism of action as that of the deadly nerve agents, however onchidal is not an organophosphorus or carbamate compound and bears little resemblance to other compounds of this nature.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parafluorofentanyl	Parafluorofentanyl	62300			90736-23-5				Para-fluorofentanyl is an opioid analgesic being an analogue of fentanyl developed by Janssen Pharmacutica in the 1960s. Para-fluorofentanyl was sold briefly on the black market in the early 1980s, before the introduction of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared. Para-fluorofentanyl is made with the same synthetic route as fentanyl, but by substituting para-fluoroaniline for aniline in the synthesis. Para-fluorofentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl but is reported to have a potency slightly stronger than the parent drug. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenylpropylaminopentane	Phenylpropylaminopentane	10262369			784118-64-5				(-)-1-Phenyl-2-propylaminopentane (-PPAP) is a drug with an unusual effects profile. It can loosely be grouped with the stimulant or antidepressant drug families, but its mechanism of action is quite different. PPAP is classified as a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the impulse propagation mediated transmitter release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain (although unlike the newer and more potent compound BPAP, it has less impact on serotonin release and affects mainly the catecholamines). Unlike stimulant drugs like amphetamine, which release a flood of monoamine neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, PPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamine and PPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamine causes neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the synapse regardless of external input, while with PPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released. Other drugs which produce this effect are the endogenous trace amines phenethylamine and tyramine, and the neuroprotective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline. However, while selegiline is a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor, PPAP has no monoamine oxidase inhibitory activity, and produces only the activity enhancer effect.

It is also referred to as 2,3,4,5,6-pentahydroxycaproic acid potassium salt, D-gluconic acid potassium salt, or potassium D-gluconate. It is 16.69% potassium by mass. By this measure, 5.99 g of potassium gluconate contains 1 g of potassium.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prodine	Prodine	204163			77-20-3				Prodine (trade names Prisilidine and Nisentil) is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of pethidine (meperidine). There are two isomers of prodine, Alphaprodine and Betaprodine. Betaprodine is some 5x more potent than alphaprodine, but is metabolised more rapidly, and only alphaprodine was developed for medicinal use. It has similar activity to pethidine, but with a faster onset of action and shorter duration. Alphaprodine was sold under several brand names, mainly Nisentil and Prisilidine. It was mainly used for pain relief in childbirth and dentistry, as well as for minor surgical procedures. Alphaprodine has a duration of action of 1 to 2 hours and 40 to 60 mg is equal to 10 mg of morphine via the subcutaneous route. Prodine has similar effects to other opioids, and produces analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. Respiratory depression can be a problem with alphaprodine even at normal therapeutic doses.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/QH-II-66	QH-II-66	9838431			183239-39-6				QH-II-66 (QH-ii-066) is a sedative drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It produces some of the same effects as other benzodiazepines, but is much more selective than most other drugs of this class and so produces somewhat less sedation and ataxia than other related drugs such as diazepam and triazolam, although it still retains anticonvulsant effects. QH-ii-066 is a highly subtype-selective GABAA agonist which was designed to bind selectively to the Î±5 subtype of GABAA receptors. The Î±5 subtype (and to a lesser extent the Î±1 subtype) of GABAA are two of the most important targets in the brain that produce the effects of alcohol, and so one of the purposes for which QH-ii-066 was developed was to reproduce the GABAergic effects of alcohol separately from its other actions. QH-ii-066 replicates some of the effects of alcohol, such as sedation and ataxia, but does not increase appetite, as this effect seems to be produced by the Î±1 subtype of GABAA rather than Î±5. It is also interesting to note that the inverse agonist Ro15-4513, which blocks the Î±4 subtype of GABAA, reverses the effects of alcohol, suggesting that this subtype is also important in producing the subjective effects of alcohol intoxication.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RTI-121	RTI-121	122190			146145-21-3				(â€“)-2Î²-Carboisopropoxy-3Î²-(4-iodophenyl)tropane (RTI-121, IPCIT) is a stimulant drug used in scientific research, which was developed in the early 1990s. RTI-121 is a phenyltropane based, highly selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor and is derived from methylecgonidine. RTI-121 is a potent and long-lasting stimulant, producing stimulant effects for more than 10 hours after a single dose in mice which would limit its potential uses in humans, as it might have significant abuse potential if used outside of a medical setting. However RTI-121 occupies the dopamine transporter more slowly than cocaine, and so might have lower abuse potential than cocaine itself.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SX-3228	SX-3228	5487538			156364-04-4				SX-3228 is a sedative and hypnotic drug used in scientific research. It has similar effects to sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. SX-3228 is a subtype-selective GABAA agonist acting primarily at the Î±1 subtype. It thus has similar effects to other Î±1-selective drugs such as zolpidem and zaleplon in animal studies. It only partly substitutes for ethanol, and is a strong sedative-hypnotic with only limited anxiolytic effects which appear only at doses that also produce significant sedation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/THC-O-acetate	THC-O-acetate	198013			23132-17-4				THC acetate ester is a derivative of THC which has been found by the DEA as an apparent controlled substance analogue of THC. It was apparently made by extracting and purifying THC from cannabis plant material using a soxhlet extractor, followed by reaction with acetic anhydride in an analogous manner to how heroin is made from morphine. A similar case was reported in June 1995 in the UK and THC-O-acetate was ruled to be a Class A drug. THC acetate was also reported to have been found by New Zealand police in 1995, again made by acetylation of purified cannabis extracts with acetic anhydride. The acetylation of THC does not change the properties of the compound to the same extent as with other acetate esters (e.g. morphine vs heroin), as the parent compound is already highly lipophilic, but potency is nonetheless increased to some extent. This derivative of THC is interesting as one of the few analogues of THC to have been encountered as a recreational drug sold and used in a highly pure smokable form. THC acetate ester was also investigated as a possible non-lethal incapacitating agent, as part of the Edgewood Arsenal experiments.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone	Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone	91475			567-03-3				Tetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (3Î±,21-dihydroxy-5Î±-pregnan-20-one; THDOC), or more preferred allotetrahydroxycorticosterone, is an endogenous neurosteroid. It is synthesized from the adrenal hormone deoxycorticosterone by the action of two enzymes, 5Î±-reductase type I and 3Î±-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. THDOC has sedative, anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effect. Changes in the normal levels of this steroid particularly during pregnancy and menstruation may be involved in some types of epilepsy, as well as stress, anxiety and depression.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thiofentanyl	Thiofentanyl	62380			60771-38-2				Thiofentanyl is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of fentanyl. Thiofentanyl was sold briefly on the black market in the early 1980s, before the introduction of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared. Thiofentanyl is made with the same synthetic route as fentanyl, but by substituting 2-(2-bromoethyl)thiophene for phenethyl bromide in the synthesis. Thiofentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thioperamide	Thioperamide	3035905			106243-16-7				Thioperamide is a potent and selective histamine H3 antagonist that is capable of crossing the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Thioperamide was used by Jean-Charles Schwartz in his early experiments regarding the H3 receptor. http://onlinelibrary. wiley. com/doi/10.1111/j.1476-5381.2011.01286. x/abstract Thioperamide was found to be an antagonist of histamine autoreceptors, which detect the presence of histamine. Thioperamide enhances the activity of histaminergic neurons by blocking autoreceptors, thus preventing the detection of histamine by neurons. This causes the neurons to release more histamine, thus increasing their activity.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Troparil	Troparil	170832			74163-84-1				Troparil (also known as -2Î²-Carbomethoxy-3Î²-phenyltropane, WIN 35,065-2, or Î²-CPT) is a stimulant drug used in scientific research. Troparil is a phenyltropane based dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) and is derived from methylecgonidine. Troparil is documented to be a few times more potent than cocaine as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, but is less potent as a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, and has a duration spanning a few times longer, since the phenyl ring is directly connected to tropane through a non-hydrolyzable carbon-carbon bond. The lack of an ester linkage removes the local anesthetic action from the drug, so troparil is a pure stimulant. This change in activity also makes troparil slightly less cardiotoxic than cocaine. The most commonly used form of troparil is the tartrate salt, but the hydrochloride and naphthalenedisulfonate salts are also available, as well as the free base.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/U-89843A	U-89843A	154689			157013-32-6				U-89843A (PNU-89843) is a sedative drug which acts as an agonist at GABAA receptors, specifically acting as a positive allosteric modulator selective for the Î±1, Î±3 and Î±6 subtypes. It has sedative effects in animals but without causing ataxia, and also acts as an antioxidant and may have neuroprotective effects. It was developed by a team at Upjohn in the 1990s.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/U-90042	U-90042	9928470			134516-99-7				U-90042 is a sedative and hypnotic drug used in scientific research. It has similar effects to sedative-hypnotic benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic. U-90042 is a GABAA agonist acting primarily at the Î±1, Î±3 and Î±6 subtypes, with a Ki of 7.8nM at Î±1, 9.5nM at Î±3 and 11.0nM at Î±6. It produces sedation and ataxia and prolongs sleeping time in mice, rats and monkeys, but does not produce amnesia and blocks the amnestic effect of diazepam, reflecting its different subtype affinity compared to benzodiazepine drugs. It was developed by a team at Novo Nordisk in the 1980s.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Y-23684	Y-23684	195253			118288-67-8				Y-23684 is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. Y-23684 is a nonselective partial agonist at GABAA receptors. It has primarily anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects, with sedative and muscle relaxant effects only appearing at higher doses. It produces little ataxia or potentiation of other sedatives such as ethanol or barbiturates when compared to the benzodiazepines diazepam and clobazam in animal tests. Y-23684 has a favourable pharmacological profile, producing strong anxiolytic and moderate anticonvulsant effects at low doses that cause little or no sedative side effects. It has been proposed for development for human medical use, but has not yet gone beyond animal tests.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/11-Hydroxy-THC	11-Hydroxy-THC	37482			36557-05-8				11-Hydroxy-Î”-tetrahydrocannabinol, abbreviated as 11-OH-THC, is the main active metabolite of THC which is formed in the body after cannabis consumption. 11-Hydroxy-THC has been shown to be active in its own right, but the effects produced are not necessarily identical to those of THC. This might partially explain the biphasic effects of cannabis, whereby some effects such as increased appetite tend to be delayed rather than occurring immediately when the drug is consumed. 11-Hydroxy-THC is subsequently metabolised further to 11-nor-9-carboxy-THC, which is not psychoactive but might still play a role in the analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects of cannabis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/14-Methoxymetopon	14-Methoxymetopon	5486940			131575-03-6				14-Methoxymetopon is an opiate analogue developed by a team led by Professor Helmut Schmidhammer at the University of Insbruck in the mid 1990s. It is a derivative of metopon in which a methoxy group has been inserted at the 14-position. It is a highly potent analgesic drug that is around 500x stronger than morphine when administered systemically; however, when given spinally or supraspinally, it exhibits analgesic activity up to a million fold greater than morphine. It binds strongly to the Î¼-opioid receptor and activates it to a greater extent than most similar opioid drugs. This produces an unusual pharmacological profile, and although 14-methoxymetopon acts as a potent Î¼-opioid full agonist in regards to some effects such as analgesia, a ceiling effect is seen on other effects such as constipation and respiratory depression which is believed to involve interaction with the Îº-opioid receptor

It was first synthesized in 1994 by a team at Purdue University led by David E. Nichols. DOTFM is the alpha-methylated analogue of 2C-TFM, and is around twice as potent in animal studies. It acts as an agonist at the 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors. In drug-substitution experiments in rats, DOTFM fully substituted for LSD and was slightly more potent than DOI. Anecdotal reports from human users suggest that DOTFM is a potent psychedelic with an extremely long duration of action, similar to Br-DFLY.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine	2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine	3025961			96206-92-7				2-Methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine (MPEP) is a research drug which was one of the first compounds found to act as a selective antagonist for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5. After being originally patented as a liquid crystal for LCDs, it was developed by the pharmaceutical company Novartis in the late 1990s. It was found to produce neuroprotective effects following acute brain injury in animal studies, although it was unclear whether these results were purely from mGluR5 blockade as it also acts as a weak NMDA antagonist, and as a positive allosteric modulator of another subtype mGlu4, and there is also evidence for a functional interaction between mGluR5 and NMDA receptors in the same populations of neurons. It was also shown to produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in animals, and to reduce the effects of morphine withdrawal, most likely due to direct interaction between mGluR5 and the Î¼-opioid receptor. The main significance of MPEP has been as a lead compound to develop more potent and selective mGluR5 antagonists such as MTEP, but research using MPEP itself continues, and recently it was shown to reduce self-administration of nicotine, cocaine, ketamine and heroin in animals, possibly through an MPEP-induced potentiation of the rewarding effect of the self-administered drug, and MPEP was also shown to possess weak reinforcing effects by itself.

It is described by Alexander Shulgin in the book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). While AL-LAD has subtly different effects than LSD, and appears to be slightly shorter lasting, their potencies are similar; an active dose of AL-LAD is reported to be between 80 and 160 micrograms. AL-LAD has been sold by some research chemical suppliers but might be considered illegal in some countries due to its structural similarity to LSD.

It is being developed for the treatment of neuropathic pain and inflammatory conditions such as arthritis. It does not however share the anti-emetic effects of other cannabinoids but may be useful for treating pain and chronic inflammatory conditions where nausea is not present. Side effects include dry mouth, tiredness and dizziness. The mechanism of action has not yet been established, but ajulemic acid may activate the CB1 receptor in a different way to psychoactive cannabinoids. Studies in animals at 100x the dose used in human trials suggest that there is some psychoactivity of ajulemic acid, comparable to that produced by tetrahydrocannabinol, however there was no difference between ajulemic acid and placebo on the ""cannabimimetic"" assay when used in humans at therapeutic doses."

BPAP (along with another similar compound PPAP) is classified as a catecholaminergic and serotonergic activity enhancer. This means that it stimulates the impulse propagation mediated transmitter release of the neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine and serotonin in the brain. However, unlike stimulant drugs like amphetamine, which release a flood of these neurotransmitters in an uncontrolled manner, BPAP instead only increases the amount of neurotransmitter that gets released when a neuron is stimulated by receiving an impulse from a neighbouring neuron. So while both amphetamine and BPAP increase the amount of neurotransmitters that get released, amphetamine causes neurons to dump neurotransmitter stores into the synapse regardless of external input, while with BPAP the pattern of neurotransmitter release is not changed, but when the neuron would normally release neurotransmitter, a larger amount than normal is released. Other drugs which produce this effect are the endogenous trace amines phenethylamine and tryptamine, and the neuroprotective MAO-B inhibitor selegiline. However, while selegiline is a potent monoamine oxidase inhibitor, BPAP is only a weak MAO-A inhibitor at high doses, and at low doses produces only the activity enhancer effect. BPAP has been shown to have neuroprotective effects similar to those of selegiline, and has been researched for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease and clinical depression.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/CI-988	CI-988	108186			130332-27-3				CI-988 (PD-134,308) is a drug which acts as a cholecystokinin antagonist, selective for the CCKB subtype. In animal studies it showed anxiolytic effects and potentiated the analgesic action of both morphine and endogenous opioid peptides, as well as preventing the development of tolerance to opioids and reducing symptoms of withdrawal. Consequently it was hoped that it might have clinical applications for the treatment of pain and anxiety in humans, but trial results were disappointing with only minimal therapeutic effects observed even at high doses. The reason for the failure of CI-988 and other CCKB antagonists in humans despite their apparent promise in pre-clinical animal studies is unclear, although poor pharmacokinetic properties of the currently available drugs are a possible explanation, and CCKB antagonists are still being researched for possible uses as adjuvants to boost the activity of other drugs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lysergic_acid_2-butyl_amide	Lysergic acid 2-butyl amide	15119692			137765-82-3				Lysergic acid 2-butyl amide (2-Butyllysergamide, LSB) is an analogue of LSD originally developed by Richard Pioch at Eli Lilly in the 1950s, but mostly publicised through research conducted by the team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. It is a structural isomer of LSD, with the two ethyl groups on the amide nitrogen having been replaced by a single butyl group, joined at the 2-position. It is one of the few lysergamide derivatives to exceed the potency of LSD in animal drug discrimination assays, with the (R) isomer having an ED50 of 33nmol/kg for producing drug-appropriate responding, vs 48nmol/kg for LSD itself. The corresponding (R)-2-pentyl analogue has higher binding affinity for the 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, but is less potent in producing drug-appropriate responding, suggesting that the butyl compound has a higher efficacy at the receptor target. The drug discrimination assay for LSD in rats involves both 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A mediated components, and while lysergic acid 2-butyl amide is more potent than LSD as a 5-HT1A agonist, it is slightly less potent as a 5-HT2A agonist, and so would probably be slightly less potent than LSD as a hallucinogen in humans. The main use for this drug has been in studies of the binding site at the 5-HT2A receptor through which LSD exerts most of its pharmacological effects, with the stereoselective activity of these unsymmetric monoalkyl lysergamides foreshadowing the subsequent development of compounds such as Lysergic acid 2,4-dimethylazetidide.

It was developed in the 1950s during research into analogues of pethidine and was assessed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime but was not included on the list of drugs under international control, probably because it was not used in medicine or widely available. Methylketobemidone is so named because it is the methyl ketone analogue of bemidone (hydroxypethidine). The more commonly used ethyl ketone (""ethylketobemidone"") is simply called ketobemidone, as it is the only drug of this family to have been marketed. Presumably methylketobemidone produces similar effects to ketobemidone and other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/RB-101	RB-101	119600			135949-60-9				RB-101 is a drug that acts as an enkephalinase inhibitor, which is used in scientific research. RB-101 is a prodrug which acts by splitting at the disulfide bond once inside the brain, to form two selective enzyme inhibitors and blocking both types of the zinc-metallopeptidase enkephalinase enzymes. This inhibits the breakdown of the endogenous opioid peptides known as enkephalins. These two enzymes, aminopeptidase N (APN) and neutral endopeptidase 24.11 (NEP), are responsible for the breakdown of both kinds of enkephalin naturally found in the body, and so RB-101 causes a build up of both Met-enkephalin and Leu-enkephalin. These peptides act primarily at the delta opioid receptor, although they also stimulate the mu opioid receptor to some extent through a delta-opioid receptor mediated interaction with another peptide cholecystokinin, and the enzyme-inhibiting effects of RB-101 thus produce indirect stimulation of both of these opioid receptor subtypes. This causes RB-101 to be strongly synergistic with cholecystokinin antagonists. Unlike the more commonly used enkephalinase inhibitor racecadotril, which only acts peripherally and has antidiarrheal effects, RB-101 is able to enter the brain, and thus produces a range of effects, acting as an analgesic, anxiolytic and antidepressant. The antidepressant and anxiolytic actions are thought to be mediated through the delta opioid receptor, while the analgesic effects most likely result from a mix of mu and delta activity. Animal studies suggest that RB-101 is also likely to be useful in relieving the symptoms of acute opioid withdrawal and in the management of opioid dependence. A significant advantage of inhibiting the breakdown of endogenous opioid peptides rather than stimulating opioid receptors with exogenous drugs is that the levels of opioid peptides are only increased slightly from natural levels, thus avoiding overstimulation and downregulation of the opioid receptors. This means that even when RB-101 is used in high doses for extended periods of time, there is no development of dependence on the drug or tolerance to its analgesic effects. Consequently even though RB-101 is able to produce potent analgesic effects via the opioid system, it is unlikely to be addictive. Unlike conventional opioid agonists, RB-101 also failed to produce respiratory depression, which suggests it might be a much safer drug than traditional opioid painkillers. RB-101 also powerfully potentiated the effects of traditional analgesics such as ibuprofen and morphine, suggesting that it could be used to boost the action of a low dose of normal opioids which would otherwise be ineffective. RB-101 itself is not orally active and so has not been developed for medical use in humans, however modification of the drug has led to newer orally acting compounds such as RB-120 and RB-3007, which may be more likely to be adopted for medical use if clinical trials are successful.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RTI-55	RTI-55	108220			133647-95-7				"RTI-55 (iometopane) is a phenyltropane-based psychostimulant used in scientific research and with some medical application/s. This drug was first cited in 1991. RTI-55 is a non-selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor derived from methylecgonidine. However, more selective analogs are derived by conversion to ""pyrrolidinoamido"" RTI-229, for instance. Due to the large bulbous nature of the weakly electron withdrawing iodo halogen atom, RTI-55 is the most strongly serotonergic of the simple para-substituted troparil based analogs. In rodents RTI-55 actually caused death at a dosage of 100 mg/kg, whereas RTI-51 and RTI-31 did not. Another notable observation is the strong propensity of RTI-55 to cause locomotor activity enhancements, although in an earlier study, RTI-51 was actually even stronger than RTI-55 in shifting baseline LMA. This observation serves to highlight the disparities that can arise between studies. RTI-55 is one of the most potent phenyltropane stimulants commercially available, which limits its use in humans, as it might have significant abuse potential if used outside of a strictly controlled medical setting. However, it is definitely worthy of mentioning that increasing the size of the halogen atom attached to troparil serves to reduce the number of lever responses in a session when these analogs were compared in a study. Although RTI-55 wasn't specifically examined in this study the number of lever responses in a given session was of the order cocaine > WIN35428 > RTI-31 > RTI-51. In contrast to RTI-31 which is predominantly dopaminergic, increasing the size of the covalently bonded halogen from a chlorine to an iodine markedly increases the affinity for the SERT, while retaining mostly all of its DAT blocking activity. If desired, a radioactive source of iodine can be utilized. I and I in particular because these are very high energy Î³-ray emitters.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Methylamphetamine	4-Methylamphetamine	199116			22683-78-9				4-Methylamphetamine (4-MA; PAL-313; AptrolÂ ; p-TAP) is a stimulant and anorectic drug of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. In vitro, it acts as a potent and balanced serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine releasing agent with Ki affinity values of 53.4nM, 22.2nM, and 44.1nM at the serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine transporters, respectively. However, more recent in vivo studies that involved performing microdialysis on rats showed a different trend. These studies showed that 4-methylamphetamine is much more potent at elevating serotonin (~18 x baseline) relative to dopamine (~5 x baseline). The authors speculated that this is because 5-HT release dampens DA release through some mechanism. For example, it was suggested that a possible cause for this could be activation of 5HT2C receptors since this is known to inhibit DA release. In addition there are alternative explanations such as 5-HT release then going on to encourage GABA release, which has an inhibitory effect on DA neurons. 4-MA was investigated as an appetite suppressant in 1952 and was even given a trade name, but development was apparently never completed. More recently it has been reported as a novel designer drug. In animal studies, 4-MA was shown to have the lowest rate of self-administration out of a range of similar drugs tested, likely as a result of having the highest potency for releasing serotonin relative to dopamine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-1220	AM-1220	9929889			137642-54-7				AM-1220 is a drug that acts as a potent and moderately selective agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB1, with around 19x selectivity for CB1 over the related CB2 receptor. It was originally invented in the early 1990s by a team led by Thomas D'Ambra at Sterling Winthrop, but has subsequently been researched by many others, most notably the team led by Alexandros Makriyannis at the University of Connecticut. The (piperidin-2-yl)methyl side chain of AM-1220 contains a stereocenter, so there are two enantiomers with quite different potency, the (R) enantiomer having a Ki of 0.27nM at CB1 while the (S) enantiomer has a much weaker Ki of 217nM. A number of related compounds are known with similar potent cannabinoid activity, with modifications such as substitution of the indole ring at the 2- or 6- positions, the naphthoyl ring substituted at the 4- position or replaced by substituted benzoyl rings or other groups, or the 1-(N-methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl) group replaced by similar heterocyclic groups such as N-methylpyrrolidin-2-ylmethyl or N-methylmorpholin-3-ylmethyl. AM-1220 was first detected as an ingredient of synthetic cannabis smoking blends in 2010.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-1221	AM-1221	11604318			335160-53-7				AM-1221 is a drug that acts as a potent and selective agonist for the cannabinoid receptor CB2, with a Ki of 0.28nM at CB2 and 52.3nM at the CB1 receptor, giving it around 180x selectivity for CB2. The 2-methyl and 6-nitro groups on the indole ring both tend to increase CB2 affinity while generally reducing affinity at CB1, explaining the high CB2 selectivity of AM-1221. However despite this relatively high selectivity for CB2, its CB1 affinity is still too strong to make it useful as a truly selective CB2 agonist, so the related compound AM-1241 is generally preferred for research purposes.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-1248	AM-1248	10293794			335160-66-2				AM-1248 is a drug that acts as a moderately potent agonist for both the cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2, but with some dispute between sources over its exact potency and selectivity. Replacing the 3-(1-naphthoyl) group found in many indole derived cannabinoid ligands, with an adamantoyl group, generally confers significant CB2 selectivity, but reasonable CB1 affinity and selectivity is retained when an N-methylpiperidin-2-ylmethyl substitution is used at the indole 1-position. The related compound 1-pentyl-3-(1-adamantoyl)indole was identified as having been sold as a cannabinoid designer drug in Hungary in 2011, along with another synthetic cannabinoid AM-679.

In animals CI-1017 improves learning and memory and increases the electrical activity of the hippocampus through activation of the M1 receptor, while minimally producing parasympathetic side effects and only at very high doses. It also inhibits production of amyloidogenic A beta peptide and increases secretion of soluble amyloid precursor protein via stimulation of the M1 receptor as well. Based on these data, it was hypothesized that CI-1017 could not only treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, but could also potentially slow its progression. It was tested in clinical trials for this purpose in the early 2000s but was apparently abandoned for unknown reasons.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isomethadone	Isomethadone	10072			466-40-0				Isomethadone, also known as isoamidone, is a synthetic opioid analgesic and antitussive related to methadone that was used formerly as a pharmaceutical drug but is now no longer marketed. It binds to and activates both the Î¼- and Î´-opioid receptors, with the (S)-isomer being the more potent of its two enantiomers. Isomethadone is a Schedule I controlled substance in the United States, and is also regulated internationally as a Schedule I controlled substance under the United Nations Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-007	JWH-007	10360860			155471-10-6				JWH-007 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors. It was the most active of the first group of N-alkyl naphoylindoles discovered by the team led by John W Huffman, several years after the family was initially described with the discovery of the N-morpholinylethyl compounds pravadoline (WIN 48,098), WIN 55,225 (JWH-200) and WIN 55,212-2 by the Sterling Winthrop group. Several other N-alkyl substituents were found to be active by Huffman's team including the n-butyl, n-hexyl, 2-heptyl and cyclohexylethyl groups, but it was subsequently determined that the 2-methyl group on the indole ring is not required for CB1 binding, and tends to increase affinity for CB2 instead. Consequently the 2-desmethyl derivative of JWH-007, JWH-018 has slightly higher binding affinity for CB1, with an optimum binding of 9.00nM at CB1 and 2.94nM at CB2, and JWH-007 displayed optimum binding of 9.50nM at CB1 and 2.94nM at CB21.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-098	JWH-098	45272116			316189-74-9				JWH-098 is a synthetic cannabinoid receptor agonist from the naphthoylindole family. It is the indole 2-methyl derivative of a closely related compound JWH-081, but has markedly different affinity for the CB1 and CB2 receptors. While JWH-081 is around 10x selective for CB1 over CB2, in JWH-098 this is reversed, and it is around 4 times weaker than JWH-081 at CB1 while being six times more potent at CB2, giving it a slight selectivity for CB2 overall. This makes JWH-098 a good example of how methylation of the indole 2-position in the naphthoylindole series tends to increase CB2 affinity, but often at the expense of CB1 binding. JWH-098 is illegal in Russia, Sweden, and the UK, although it is unclear whether it has any history of human use.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-193	JWH-193	10250276			133438-58-1				JWH-193 is a drug from the aminoalkylindole family which acts as a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It was invented by the pharmaceutical company Sanofi-Winthrop in the early 1990s. JWH-193 has a binding affinity at the CB1 receptor of 6nM, binding around seven times more tightly than the parent compound JWH-200, though with closer to twice the potency of JWH-200 in activity tests. A structural isomer of JWH-193 with the methyl group on the indole ring instead of the naphthoyl ring, was also found to be of similarly increased potency over JWH-200.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-203	JWH-203	44397500			864445-54-5				JWH-203 (1-pentyl-3-indole) is an analgesic chemical from the phenylacetylindole family that acts as a cannabinoid agonist with approximately equal affinity at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, having a Ki of 8.0nM at CB1 and 7.0nM at CB2. It was originally discovered by, and named after, Dr. John W. Huffman, but has subsequently been sold without his permission as an ingredient of synthetic cannabis smoking blends. Similar to the related 2'-methoxy compound JWH-250, the 2'-bromo compound JWH-249, and the 2'-methyl compound JWH-251, JWH-203 has a phenylacetyl group in place of the naphthoyl ring used in most aminoalkylindole cannabinoid compounds, and has the strongest in vitro binding affinity for the cannabinoid receptors of any compound in the phenylacetyl group. Unexpectedly despite its weaker CB1 Ki in vitro, the 2-methylindole derivative JWH-204 is actually more potent than JWH-203 in animal tests for cannabinoid activity, though it is still weaker than JWH-249.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-210	JWH-210	45270396			824959-81-1				"JWH-210 is an analgesic chemical from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a potent cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with Ki values of 0.46nM at CB1 and 0.69nM at CB2. It is one of the most potent 4-substituted naphthoyl derivatives in the naphthoylindole series, having a higher binding affinity (i.e. lower Ki) at CB1 than both its 4-methyl and 4-n-propyl homologues JWH-122 (CB1 Ki 0.69nM) and JWH-182 (CB1 Ki 0.65nM) respectively, and than the 4-methoxy compound JWH-081 (CB1 Ki 1.2nM). It was discovered by and named after Dr. John W. Huffman. JWH-210 and JWH-122 were banned in Sweden on 1 October 2010 as hazardous goods harmful to health, after being identified as ingredients in ""herbal"" synthetic cannabis products. The substances JWH-210, JWH-122 and JWH-203 were classified as illegal drugs by the Swedish government as of 1 September 2011."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JZ-IV-10	JZ-IV-10	11291199			807342-16-1				JZ-IV-10 is a piperidine derivative related to nocaine which is a highly potent triple reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). The eugeroic modafinil, was used as a lead to fuel these compounds' discovery (J. Zhou, et al. 2004). Although it turns out that the QSAR of the pharmacophoric elements do not appear to be strongly similar. The other isomers were also prepared, although they are weaker than the R,S probes invented in the current study (R. He, et al. 2005). Upon treatment of the ligands with the sulfur atom is oxidized. The resultant molecules then lose most of their potency. This is not a major concern though. Little has been reported about the SAR of modafinil itself, and it is interesting to consider how these new findings could be applied retrospectively. The NRI selective molecules were employed as brain imaging agents to unravel details about the NE transporter. NRIs are important probes, but they do not function as robust reinforcers.

It has a reasonably fast rate of occupancy of dopamine transporters in the brain, though slower than that of cocaine itself. RTI-120 has a short duration of action, along with other p-methyl substituted phenyltropanes such as RTI-150, RTI-171 and RTI-199, giving it a more similar pharmacological profile to cocaine compared to longer acting analogues like RTI-121 and RTI-177.

With the combination of two potent dopamine transporter (DAT) binding motifs attached to the tropane ring, the p-iodophenyl group at the 3Î²-position and a pyrrolidine carboxamide at 2Î², RTI-229 has extremely high selectivity for the dopamine transporter (2600x and 4600x selective over NET and 5-HTT respectively) and is one of the most DAT-selective compounds in the RTI series.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RTI-371	RTI-371	11474847			652978-45-5				3Î²-(4-methylphenyl)-2Î²-[3-(4-chlorophenyl)isoxazol-5-yl 3-(4-chlorophenyl)isoxazol-5-yl]tropane (RTI-371) is a phenyltropane derived drug which acts as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor in vitro, yet unusually for this class of compound, both RTI-371 and the closely related compound RTI-370 failed to produce locomotor stimulation in mice. In addition to this, in drug substitution tests RTI-370 weakly generalized to cocaine whereas RTI-371 did not generalize at all. This phenomenon has also been observed for other dopamine reuptake inhibitors from other classes. It may be caused by lack of BBB penetration, or interactions at alternative receptor sites. Recently the second of these hypotheses was suggested for this compound when it was discovered that RTI-371 also acts as a positive allosteric modulator of the hCB1 human cannabinoid receptor.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ro4-1539	Ro4-1539	20834001			27767-85-7				Ro4-1539 (Furethylnorlevorphanol) is an opioid analgesic drug from the morphinan series that was developed by the pharmaceutical company Hoffmannâ€“La Roche in the 1950s. It acts as a potent Î¼-opioid agonist, and was found to be around 30-60x more potent than the related drug levorphanol in animal experiments. While it is notable for its high potency, being among the more potent Î¼-agonist found in the morphinan series of drugs (though not on the scale of acetorphine and other morphinans in the extremity of their level of potency), Ro4-1539 had no particular clinical advantages over other available opioid drugs, and was never commercially marketed. Ro4-1539 has never been formally trialled in humans, but based on its effects in animals it would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and also respiratory depression, which could be harmful or fatal.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ro5-4864	Ro5-4864	1688			14439-61-3				"Ro5-4864 (4'-Chlorodiazepam) is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative, the 4'-chloro derivative of diazepam. However unlike most benzodiazepine derivatives, Ro5-4864 lacks affinity for GABAA receptors and lacks typical benzodiazepine effects, instead being sedative yet also convulsant and anxiogenic in effects. Ro5-4864 was found to be a potent ligand for the ""peripheral benzodiazepine receptor"", later renamed to mitochondrial translocator protein 18kDa (TSPO). Interestingly despite its convulsant effects, at lower doses Ro5-4864 has proved to be neuroprotective and has become widely used for research into the role of the TSPO protein in neurotoxicity, as well as having analgesic and possible antidepressant, cardioprotective and anti-cancer effects."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/S-14,671	S-14,671	131907			135722-27-9				S-14,671 is a naphthylpiperazine derivative which acts as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist (pKi = 9.3) with high efficacy and exceptional in vivo potency, and also as a 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptor antagonist (both are pKi = 7.8). It displays only low and non-significant affinity for 5-HT1B and 5-HT3 sites. In producing 5-HT1A-mediated effects such as hypothermia and spontaneous tail flicks in rodents, S-14,671 is active at doses as low as 5 mcg s.c. , and is about 10-fold more potent than 8-OH-DPAT and 100-fold more potent than flesinoxan and buspirone. Other 5-HT1A-mediated effects of S-14,671 include induction of flat-body posture, corticosterone secretion, inhibition of morphine-induced antinociception, and attenuation of the electrical activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus. S-14,671 has been found to possess powerful efficacy in the rodent forced swim test and in the pigeon conflict test, indicating marked antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, respectively, of which are also 5-HT1A-mediated. It has never been trialed in humans, perhaps due to its potency being too great.

Increasing the O-alkoxy chain length in this series gives generally increasing potency and selectivity for 5-HT1D, with highest activity found for the nonyloxy derivative, having a 5-HT1D binding affinity of 1.0nM, and around 300x selectivity over the related 5-HT1A receptor.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-APB	5-APB	9837232			286834-80-8				5-(2-aminopropyl)benzofuran or 1-benzofuran-5-ylpropan-2-amine (5-APB) is a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor with Ki values of 180, 265 and 811 for NET, DAT and SERT respectively as well as being a potent agonist for the 5-HT2B receptor (Ki 14nM). This agonism for 5-HT2B makes it likely that 5-APB would be cardiotoxic with long term use, as seen in other 5-HT2B agonists such as fenfluramine and MDMA. The subjective effects and structure-activity relationship suggest that 5-APB is also a monoamine releasing agent. 5-APB is commonly found as the succinate and hydrochloride salt. The hydrochloride salt is 10% more potent by mass and doses should be adjusted accordingly. 5-APB is also an agonist of the 5-HT2C receptor as well as a triple monoamine reuptake inhibitor. It has been sold as a designer drug since 2010. Anecdotal reports from users suggest it has stimulant and empathogenic effects, but less psychedelic action than related compounds such as 6-APB and 5-APDB.

Like cetuximab, nimotuzumab binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), a signalling protein that normally controls cell division. In some cancers, this receptor is altered to cause uncontrolled cell division, a hallmark of cancer. These monoclonal antibodies block EGFR and stop the uncontrolled cell division. Most monoclonal antibodies are originally created by mouse cells, but this can cause an immune reaction to mouse proteins. Humanised antibodies are made using parts of mouse proteins and parts of human proteins, which causes less of an immune reaction. Nimotuzumab contains 95% human antibody sequences. This reduces adverse effects such as rash, diarrhea and conjunctivitis.

Recent studies have concluded that mepolizumab may improve exacerbations in patients with severe eosinophilic asthma, an adult-onset asthma which represents less than 5% of all asthma. IL-5 is a chemical messenger in the immune system that stimulates the growth of eosinophils. In eosinophilic asthma, eosinophils are present in the lungs. When mepolizumab was given to people with eosinophilic asthma, it eliminated eosinophils from the bloodstream,and reduced eosinophils in the lungs and bone marrow. Mepolizumab also reduced the number of asthma exacerbations, and reduced the need for corticosteroids. Mepolizumab improved the quality of life, but the improvement was ""not clinically meaningful,"" according to a reviewer. In a recent multi-centre, double-blinded, randomised, controlled trial study of Mepolizumab in severe eosinophilic asthma, Mepolizumab reduced the number of clinically significant exacerbations compared to a placebo. Additionally Mepolizumab reduced sputum and blood eosinophil counts and was shown to be safe for up to 12 months. Mepolizumab is also in development for the management of hypereosinophilic syndrome by GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) and has received orphan drug designation by the FDA.

Î¨-DOM was first reported by Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL (Phenethylamines i Have Known And Loved). Î¨-DOM has similar effects to DOM, but is only around 1/3 - 1/2 the potency, with an active dose reported to be between 15-25 milligrams. The effects of Î¨-DOM last for around 6â€“8 hours. The activity of Î¨-DOM demonstrates that the two methoxy groups on the psychedelic phenethylamines are not strictly limited to the 2,5 positions on the phenyl ring. Indeed any of the 2Cx or DOx series of drugs could alternatively be made as the 2,6 isomer and would still be expected to show similar activity, although slightly less potent. In theory this would vastly expand the range of different hallucinogens that could be derived from this family of drugs. The 2,6 isomer of another similar drug 2C-D-FLY has also been made by David E. Nichols and found to be active, this might by extension be referred to as Î¨-2C-D-FLY.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Raxibacumab	Raxibacumab				565451-13-0				"Raxibacumab is a human monoclonal antibody intended for the prophylaxis and treatment of inhaled anthrax. Its efficacy has been proved in rabbits and monkeys. As of January 2011, the drug has reached stage three clinical testing in humans. The antibody was discovered in a joint venture between Cambridge Antibody Technology and Human Genome Sciences. Cambridge Antibody Technology discovered the antibody to Human Genome Sciences's target and, in 2012, HGS were purchased by GlaxoSmithKline. According to GSK ""Raxibacumab injection is a monoclonal antibody targeting the protective antigen (PA) component of the lethal toxin of Bacillus anthracis and is being developed for the treatment of inhalational anthrax. The most commonly observed adverse events were headaches, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea, pain in extremity (pain in limbs) and pruritus (skin itching). Local skin reaction in one study has led to the recommendation that an anti-histamine be administered prior to infusion. "" GSK go on to say ""Raxibacumab was developed by Human Genome Sciences (HGS) in conjunction with the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA) of the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response (ASPR), U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under contract number HHS010020050006C. It is now part of GSKâ€™s portfolio, following GSKâ€™s acquisition of HGS in July 2012. The development of raxibacumab is the result of a coordinated response to a recognised public health threat and the US governmentâ€™s request for new medical countermeasures in the event of an anthrax attack against the civilian population. "" At the 2 November 2012 meeting of the Anti-Infective Drugs Advisory Committee to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) members ""voted 16 to 1 in support of the clinical benefit of raxibacumab for the treatment of inhalational anthrax, with one abstention. In addition, the committee voted 18 â€“ 0 in favour of the risk-benefit profile of raxibacumab"". In 2009, support from the FDA was denied after it ""expressed doubt on the agent's added benefit over the antibiotic levofloxacin (Levaquin) alone"". On Dec. 14, 2012, FDA approved raxibacumab injection to treat inhalational anthrax, a form of the infectious disease caused by breathing in the spores of the bacterium Bacillus anthracis. Raxibacumab also is approved to prevent inhalational anthrax when alternative therapies are not available or not appropriate."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rovelizumab	Rovelizumab				197099-66-4				Rovelizumab, also known as LeukArrest and Hu23F2G, is a humanized monoclonal antibody which was an experimental immunosuppressive drug. Rovelizumab was developed by Icos to treat patients suffering from haemorrhagic shock. The drug is a monoclonal antibody that suppresses white blood cells which become overly active during shock. During testing the number of patients given the drug was low because rovelizumab had to be delivered within four hours of the injury and consent was required. Often the patient was unconscious and relatives had to be reached to give consent. In JuneÂ 1998, Icos and many medical centers asked the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to waive consent requirements in situations where the patient was at high risk of dying and relatives could not be reached. While some medical ethicists opposed waiving consent, the FDA approved the proposal in AugustÂ 1998 for five medical centers. Development of rovelizumab was halted in AprilÂ 2000 when interim data from phaseÂ III clinical trials did not meet Icos's goals. The company's goals for rovelizumab included reducing the chance of multiple organ failure and reducing the death-rate from shock at 28Â days. Rovelizumab was also being tested for treating heart attack, multiple sclerosis, and stroke, and was being explored as a treatment for cerebral vasospasm, head trauma, kidney transplantation, and restenosis. Multiple companies have tried to develop anti-CD18 drugs, but none of them have been successful. Among them are Genentech's erlizumab, and two drugs developed by Protein Design Labs (PDL) and Centocor. Although trials in humans have not gone well, the research of anti-CD18 drugs in animals has been encouraging. It is thought that the experimental medicines are affecting the lymphocyte adhesion pathway in humans in unintended ways.

The function of the 5-HT5A receptor remains poorly defined, but SB-699,551 was found to modulate serotonin release from neurons, suggesting it acts as a presynaptic inhibitory autoreceptor similar to the 5-HT1B and 5-HT1D receptors. Multiple therapeutic roles have been suggested for 5-HT5A ligands due to the presence of this receptor in several areas of the brain, but research is still at an early stage.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/25I-NBMD	25I-NBMD				919797-25-4				25I-NBMD (NBMD-2C-I, Cimbi-29) is a derivative of the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2C-I, discovered in 2006 by a team at Purdue University led by David Nichols. It acts as a potent partial agonist for the 5HT2A receptor with a Ki of 0.049nM at the human 5HT2A receptor. The corresponding 4-bromo analogue 25B-NBMD has been used for molecular dynamics studies on the shape of the 5-HT2A receptor. Common doses are reported to be between 500 Mcg and 1.5 mg. Although the low end of the dose response curve is similar to LSD, being active at 500Â Mcg, some reports show 1.5â€“2.0Â mg being a low dose, making it up to four times less active than its nbome counterpart 25I-NBOMe. Because it is a research chemical and has not been on the open market for long, there are very few reports about its use.

It is part of the AM series of cannabinoids discovered by Alexandros Makriyannis at Northeastern University. Reputed recreational use of AM-2201 in the United States has led to it being specifically listed in a proposed 2011 amendment to the Controlled Substances Act, aiming to add a number of synthetic drugs into Schedule I. There have been anecdotal reports of individuals experiencing panic attacks and vomiting, at doses as small as 2 milligrams. As the dosage is much smaller than most other synthetic cannabinoids, users may accidentally dose too much. Convulsions have been reported at doses exceeding 10 milligrams. Caution should be taken if using this substance as it is active at doses as small as 500 Âµg (micrograms), has a very steep dose-response curve, and tolerance builds up very quickly to the effects. As of November 2011, there have been no reports of death associated with the drug. The toxicity of AM-2201 is still a matter of debate and there may be long term side effects.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/S-40503	S-40503	9879175							S-40503 is an investigational selective androgen receptor modulator (SARM) developed by the Japanese company Kaken Pharmaceuticals, which was developed for the treatment of osteoporosis. SARMs are a new class of drugs which produce tissue-specific anabolic effects in some tissues such as muscle and bone, but without stimulating androgen receptors in other tissues such as in the prostate gland, thus avoiding side effects such as benign prostatic hypertrophy which can occur following treatment with unselective androgens like testosterone or anabolic steroids. S-40503 is a SARM that shows good functional selectivity for bone tissue, and has relatively little effect on muscle mass and no observable effect on the prostate gland. In animal studies it was shown to increase both bone mineral density and biomechanical strength of femoral cortical bone, and at low doses showed anabolic effects only on bone tissue, while at higher doses both bone and muscle growth were affected, yet prostate gland enlargement was not seen at any dose tested. The lack of virilizing effects means that S-40503 may even be suitable for use in women, which would be a substantial advantage over existing drugs as women tend to be more likely to suffer from osteoporosis, and are generally contraindicated from taking anabolic steroids due to the risk of side effects such as masculinisation and hirsutism. Since these promising initial studies, no further data about S-40503 has been published by Kaken, and it is thought that rather than being developed for human use itself, S-40503 may be more likely to be used as a lead compound for the development of novel derivatives with similar bone anabolic effects, but longer in vivo half-life and better bioavailability. Selective androgen receptor modulators may also be used by athletes to assist in training and increase physical stamina and fitness, potentially producing effects similar to anabolic steroids but with significantly less side effects. For this reason, SARMs have already been banned by the World Anti-Doping Agency since January 2008 despite no drugs from this class yet being in clinical use, and blood tests for all known SARMs are currently being developed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SRT1720	SRT1720	24180125							SRT1720 is a drug developed by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals intended as a small-molecule activator of the sirtuin subtype SIRT1. It has similar activity in the body to the known SIRT1 activator resveratrol, but is 1000x more potent. In animal studies it was found to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increased mitochondrial and metabolic function.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-087	AM-087	10717065							AM-087 is an analgesic drug that is a cannabinoid agonist. It is a derivative of Î”8THC substituted on the 3-position side chain. AM-087 is a potent CB1 agonist with a Ki of 0.43nM, making it around 100x more potent than THC itself. This is most likely due to the bulky bromine substituent on the side chain.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-411	AM-411	9799945							AM-411 is an analgesic drug that is a cannabinoid agonist. It is a derivative of Î”8THC substituted with an adamantyl group at the 3-position, demonstrating that the binding pocket for the alkyl chain at this position can accommodate significant bulk. AM-411 is a potent and fairly selective CB1 full agonist with a Ki of 6.80nM, but is still also a moderately potent CB2 agonist with a Ki of 52.0nM. It produces similar effects to other cannabinoid agonists such as analgesia, sedation, and anxiolysis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-855	AM-855	10091328							AM-855 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid agonist. It is a derivative of Î”Tetrahydrocannabinol with a conformationally restricted side chain which has been bound into a fourth ring fused to the aromatic A-ring of the cannabinoid skeleton. AM-855 is an agonist at both CB1 and CB2 with moderate selectivity for CB1, with a Ki of 22.3nM at CB1 and 58.6nM at CB2.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-905	AM-905	9998522							AM-905 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid agonist with a conformationally restricted side chain. It is a potent and reasonably selective agonist for the CB1 cannabinoid receptor, with a Ki of 1.2nM at CB1 and 5.3nM at CB2.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-919	AM-919	10741414							"AM-919 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It is a derivative of HU-210 which has been substituted with a 6Î²-(3-hydroxypropyl) group. This adds a ""southern"" aliphatic hydroxyl group to the molecule as seen in the CP-series of nonclassical cannabinoid drugs, and so AM-919 represents a hybrid structure between the classical and nonclassical cannabinoid families. AM-919 is somewhat less potent than HU-210 itself, but is still a potent agonist at both CB1 and CB2 with moderate selectivity for CB1, with a Ki of 2.2nM at CB1 and 3.4nM at CB2."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AM-938	AM-938	10646208							"AM-938 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid receptor agonist. It is a derivative of HU-210 which has been substituted with a 6Î²-(3-hydroxyprop-1-ynyl) group. This adds a ""southern"" aliphatic hydroxyl group to the molecule as seen in the CP-series of nonclassical cannabinoid drugs, and so AM-938 represents a hybrid structure between the classical and nonclassical cannabinoid families, with the 6-hydroxyalkyl chain rigidified with a triple bond. This gives AM-938 a greater degree of selectivity, so while it is still a potent agonist at both CB1 and CB2, it is reasonably selective for CB2, with a Ki of 0.3nM at CB2 and 1.2nM at CB1, a selectivity of around 4x."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/AMG-36	AMG-36	10982174							AMG-36 is an analgesic drug which is a cannabinoid agonist. It is a derivative of Î”8THC substituted with a cyclopentane group on the 3-position side chain.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/BTS_74,398	BTS 74,398	24838024							BTS 74,398 is a centrally acting stimulant drug which was developed for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It inhibits the synaptic reuptake of dopamine, serotonin and noradrenaline, making it a triple reuptake inhibitor. It was effective in animal models of Parkinson's disease, but was unsuccessful in human trials.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Biphenylindanone_A	Biphenylindanone A	9868580							Biphenylindanone A (BINA, LS-193,571) is a research agent which acts as a potent and selective positive allosteric modulator for the group II metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR2. In animal studies it showed anxiolytic and antipsychotic effects, and blocked the effects produced by the hallucinogenic drug DOB. BINA and other selective mGluR2 positive modulators have therefore been suggested as a novel class of drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia which may have superior properties to traditional antipsychotic drugs. BINA decreases cocaine self-administration in rats, with no effect on food self-administration, and is in regard to this discrimination superior to the mGluR2/3 agonist LY-379,268
http://dbpedia.org/resource/C-8813	C-8813	11058633							C-8813 is a potent Î¼-opioid agonist with a distinctive chemical structure which is not closely related to other established families of opioid drugs. The trans isomer was found to be around 591x more potent than morphine in animal studies. The same study assigned a potency of 504x morphine to BDPC. C-8813 is claimed to be similarly potent at the Î´-opioid receptor, which antagonizes the mu depression of breathing, presumably making the drug safer. C-8813 has never been used in humans, but would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal. Tachyphylaxis would likely develop rapidly with repeated administration.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fluvalinate	Fluvalinate	50516							Fluvalinate (trade names include Apistan, Klartan, Minadox) is a synthetic pyrethroid commonly used to control varroa mites in honey bee colonies. Fluvalinate is a stable, non-volatile, fat-soluble compound. Fluvalinate effectiveness was demonstrated in France and Israel. Although the compound may be found in drones, a study has found honey samples virtually absent of fluvalinate, on account of its affinity to beeswax. Tau-fluvalinate (Ï„-fluvalinate) is the trivial name for (2R)-fluvalinate. The C atom in the valinate structure is in D-configuration, while the second chiral atom is a mixture of both R and S.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/GTS-21	GTS-21	5310985							GTS-21 (DMXB-A) is a drug that acts as a partial agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. It binds to both the Î±4Î²2 and Î±7 subtypes, but activates only the Î±7 to any significant extent. Both GTS-21 itself and its demethylated active metabolite 4-OH-GTS-21 display nootropic and neuroprotective effects, and GTS-21 is being investigated for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, nicotine dependence, and, most significantly, for schizophrenia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/J-113,397	J-113,397	5311194							J-113,397 is an opioid analgesic drug which was the first compound found to be a highly selective antagonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 receptor. It is several hundred times selective for the ORL-1 receptor over other opioid receptors, and its effects in animals include preventing the development of tolerance to morphine, the prevention of hyperalgesia induced by intracerebroventricular administration of nociceptin (orphanin FQ), as well as the stimulation of dopamine release in the striatum, which increases the rewarding effects of cocaine, but may have clinical application in the treatment of Parkinson's disease.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lithium_succinate	Lithium succinate	10197702							Lithium succinate, the lithium salt of succinic acid, is a drug used in the treatment of seborrhoeic dermatitis and proposed for the treatment of anogenital warts.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/O-1238	O-1238	10761489							O-1238 is a drug which is a cannabinoid derivative that is used in scientific research. It is a partial agonist at the cannabinoid receptor CB1, producing a maximal stimulation of 58.3% with a Ki of 8.45nM.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/O-2172	O-2172	11778793							O-2172 is a drug developed by Organix Inc, which acts as a stimulant and potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It is an analogue of methylphenidate where the phenyl ring has had a 3,4-dichloro substitution added, and the piperidine ring has been replaced by cyclopentane. It is around 1/3 the potency of methylphenidate, demonstrating that even with the important binding group of the nitrogen lone pair removed entirely, selective DAT binding and reuptake inhibition is still possible.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oleoyl-estrone	Oleoyl-estrone	6918373							Oleoyl-estrone (OE) is a fatty acid ester of estrone. It is a naturally circulating hormone in animals, including humans. It was studied as a potential weight-loss drug, but failed to show benefit in clinical trials. It was first reported in 1996 to cause a body fat loss effect in rats in the International Journal of Obesity and Related Metabolic Disorders. The animal research has all been conducted by the Nitrogen-Obesity Research Group of the University of Barcelona. The compound was found to potently induce body-fat loss while preserving protein stores in animals which is the ultimate goal of an anti-obesity agent as body protein loss is an undesired but inevitable (to some degree) side effect of fat loss via calorie restriction.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SB-277,011-A	SB-277,011-A	5311096							SB-277,011A is a drug which acts as a potent and selective dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, which is around 80-100x selective for D3 over D2, and lacks any partial agonist activity. SB-277,011A is used in the study of addiction to stimulant drugs such as nicotine and cocaine. Where cocaine reduces the threshold for brain electrical self-stimulation in rats, an indication of cocaine's rewarding effects, SB-277,011A completely reverses this effect. It may thus be useful in the treatment of addiction to nicotine and cocaine, and is also being investigated for potential uses in the treatment of other drug addictions, such as addiction to heroin and alcohol. Another potential application for SB-277,011A is in the treatment of schizophrenia, and it may be particularly useful in treating comorbid patients who are both schizophrenic and addicted to drugs. However it may worsen side effects such as tardive dyskinesia in patients who are already prescribed antipsychotic drugs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SB-612,111	SB-612,111	10047612							SB-612,111 is an opioid receptor ligand which is a potent and selective antagonist for the nociceptin receptor (ORL-1), several times more potent than the older drug J-113,397. It does not have analgesic effects in its own right, but prevents the development of hyperalgesia, and also shows antidepressant effects in animal studies.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SM-130,686	SM-130,686	9890863							SM-130,686 is a drug which acts as a potent, orally active growth hormone secretagogue, with around half the potency of the endogenous agonist ghrelin as a stimulator of growth hormone release. It produces dose-dependent increases in muscle mass and decrease in body fat, and is under investigation for the treatment of growth hormone deficiency and other medical conditions. Concerns about its potential use as a performance-enhancing drug for athletes have led to the development of urine tests for SM-130,686 and other growth hormone secretagogues, even though no drugs from this class have yet progressed to clinical use.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tropoxane	Tropoxane	9796921							Tropoxane is an aryloxytropane derivative drug developed by Organix Inc. , which acts as a stimulant and potent dopamine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. It is an analogue of dichloropane where the amine nitrogen has been replaced by an oxygen ether link (at the bridgehead position), demonstrating that the amine nitrogen is not required for DAT binding and reuptake inhibition. P. Meltzer, et al. made some 8-thiabicyclo(3.2.1)octanes recently (2007). For SAR purposes, a table has been included that lists some of these compounds. It had been hypothesized that transporter binding of the tropanes might include ionic bonding of the central tropane nitrogen. But it turned out that at this site neither ionic nor hydrogen bonding is a prerequisite for potent monoamine reuptake inhibition. Oxa- and thia-analogs of RTI-111 are potent inhibitors, and even an N-replacement by methylene holds the potency within the same magnitude. However, N-quaternisation (N-dimethyl) considerably reduces DAT affinity. 2[edit] In this SAR, the focus is on seeing the effect of changing 8-NMe to S, O, or CH2. Both enantiomers, as well as the racemates are presented in several cases for comparison.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/(R)-3-Nitrobiphenyline	(R)-3-Nitrobiphenyline	16757089							(R)-3-Nitrobiphenyline is a drug which acts as an Î±2-adrenergic agonist, selective for the Î±2C subtype, as well as being a weak antagonist at the Î±2A and Î±2B subtypes.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Phenylfentanyl	4-Phenylfentanyl	10319503							4-Phenylfentanyl is an opioid analgesic that is a derivative of fentanyl. It was developed during the course of research that ultimately resulted in super-potent opioid derivatives such as carfentanil, though it is a substantially less potent analogue. 4-Phenylfentanyl is around 8x the potency of fentanyl in analgesic tests on animals, but more complex 4-heteroaryl derivatives such as substituted thiophenes and thiazoles are more potent still, as they are closer bioisosteres to the 4-carbomethoxy group of carfentanil. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl, and include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/ABT-202	ABT-202	39220800							ABT-202 is a drug developed by Abbott, which acts as an agonist at neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and has been researched for use as an analgesic, although it has not passed clinical trials.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/CCG-4986	CCG-4986	1328227							CCG-4986 is a drug which is the first non-peptide compound discovered that acts as a selective inhibitor of the Regulator of G protein signalling protein subtype RGS4. Regulators of G protein signalling are proteins which act to limit and shorten the response produced inside a cell following activation of a G protein-coupled receptor. Since different RGS subtypes are expressed in different tissues and are associated with particular receptors, this makes it possible for selective inhibitors of RGS proteins to be developed, which should be able to enhance the activity of a particular receptor in a defined target tissue, but not elsewhere in the body.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/CGP-7930	CGP-7930	5024764							CGP-7930 is a compound used in scientific research which acts as a positive allosteric modulator at the GABAB receptor. It has anxiolytic effects in animal studies, and has a synergistic effect with GABAB agonists such as baclofen and GHB, as well as reducing self-administration of ethanol and cocaine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/GBLD-345	GBLD-345	4602899							GBLD-345 is an anxiolytic drug used in scientific research, which acts as a nonselective full agonist at GABAA receptors. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/N-Phenethylnormorphine	N-Phenethylnormorphine	46908217							N-Phenethylnormorphine is an opiate analgesic drug derived from morphine by replacing the N-methyl group with Î²-phenethyl. It is around eight to fourteen times more potent than morphine as a result of this modification, in contrast to most other N-substituted derivatives of morphine, which are substantially less active, or act as antagonists. Binding studies have helped to explain the increased potency of N-phenethylnormorphine, showing that the phenethyl group extends out to reach an additional binding point deeper inside the mu opioid receptor cleft, analogous to the binding of the phenethyl group on fentanyl.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RTI-177	RTI-177	9800708							"RTI-177 (2Î²--3Î²-tropane, Î²-CPPIT) is a synthetic stimulant drug from the phenyltropane family, which acts as a DRI with micromolar affinity for the SERT. RTI-177 has an unusually long duration of action of 20 hours or more, substantially longer than the related compound RTI-336 from which it differs in molecular structure only by the absence of a p-methyl group. ""the nonselective monoamine transporter inhibitor RTI-126 and the DAT-selective inhibitors RTI-150 and RTI-336 both had a faster rate of onset (30 min) and a short duration of action (4h). In contrast, the nonselective monoamine transporter inhibitor RTI-112 had a slower rate of onset (30â€“60 min) and a longer duration of action (10h). The DAT-selective inhibitors RTI-171 and RTI-177 also had slower rates of onset (30â€“120 min), but RTI-171 had a short duration of action (2.5 h) while RTI-177 had a very long duration of action (20 h)."""

http://dbpedia.org/resource/S-17092	S-17092	9977327							S-17092 is a drug which acts as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme Prolyl endopeptidase. This enzyme is involved in the metabolic breakdown of a number of neuropeptide neurotransmitters in the brain, and so inhibiting the action of the enzyme increases the activity of these neuropeptides. This produces nootropic effects which make S-17092 a promising and novel treatment for neurodegenerative conditions such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SRT2183	SRT2183	24180126							SRT2183 is a drug in development by Sirtris Pharmaceuticals intended as a small-molecule activator of the sirtuin subtype SIRT1. It has similar activity in the body to another SIRT1 activator SRT1720, but is closer in potency to resveratrol. In animal studies it was found to improve insulin sensitivity and lower plasma glucose levels in fat, muscle and liver tissue, and increased mitochondrial and metabolic function. However, the claim that SRT2183 is a SIRT1 activator has been questioned and further defended.

It functions as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA). TAI is the aminoindane analogue of norfenfluramine and is approximately 50% as neurotoxic in comparison.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/UWA-101	UWA-101	17756669							UWA-101 is a phenethylamine derivative invented at the University of Western Australia and researched as a potential treatment for Parkinson's disease. Its chemical structure is very similar to that of the illegal drug MDMA, the only difference being the replacement of the Î±-methyl group with an Î±-cyclopropyl group. MDMA has been found in animal studies and reported in unauthorised human self-experiments to be effective in the short-term relief of Parkinson's disease symptoms, especially when used alongside conventional treatment with L-DOPA. However the illegal status of MDMA and concerns about its abuse potential, neurotoxicity and potentially dangerous side effects mean that it is unlikely to be investigated for medical use in this application, and so alternative analogues were investigated. Replacing the Î±-methyl with a cyclopropyl dramatically reduces affinity for the noradrenaline transporter and 5-HT2A receptor targets, while retaining high serotonin transporter affinity and markedly increasing affinity for the dopamine transporter (and as such, it is one of the few selective SDRIs or serotonin-dopamine reuptake inhibitors). This change causes UWA-101 to lack cytotoxicity and MDMA-like behavioral effects in animals, but while retaining similar or slightly improved anti-Parkinsonian effectiveness when compared to MDMA. This research was a continuation of earlier work from the same team which showed that replacing the Î±-methyl group of MDMA with larger aromatic ring systems produced compounds which lacked psychoactivity and neurotoxicity, but had potent anti-cancer effects against Burkitt's lymphoma cells in vitro.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/(+)-Naloxone	(+)-Naloxone	5491858							"(+)-Naloxone (dextro-naloxone) is a drug which is the ""unnatural"" enantiomer of the opioid antagonist drug (-)-naloxone. Unlike ""normal"" naloxone, (+)-naloxone has no significant affinity for opioid receptors, but instead has been discovered to act as a selective antagonist of Toll-like receptor 4. This receptor is involved in immune system responses, and activation of TLR4 induces glial activation and release of inflammatory mediators such as TNF-Î± and Interleukin-1."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/TPA-023	TPA-023						oral	hepatic	TPA-023 is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure, which is used in scientific research. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. It is a subtype-selective, mixed agonist-antagonist at GABAA receptors, which acts as a partial agonist at the Î±2 and Î±3 subtypes, but as a silent antagonist at Î±1 and Î±5 subtypes. It has primarily anxiolytic and anticonvulsant effects in animal tests, but with no sedative effects even at 50Ã— the effective anxiolytic dose. In human trials on healthy volunteers, TPA-023 was comparable to lorazepam, but had much less side effects on cognition, memory, alertness or coordination. In Phase II trials, the compound was significantly superior to placebo without inducing sedation. The clinical development was halted due to preclinical toxicity (cataract) in long term dosing studies. TPA-023 is well absorbed following oral administration and extensively metabolised by the liver, with a half-life of 6.7 hours. The main enzyme involved in its metabolism is CYP3A4, with some contribution by CYP3A5.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/N-Methylcarfentanil	N-Methylcarfentanil							?	N-Methylcarfentanil (R-32395) is an opioid analgesic drug related to the highly potent animal tranquilizer carfentanil, but several thousand times weaker, being only slightly stronger than morphine. It was first synthesised by a team of chemists at Janssen Pharmaceutica led by Paul Janssen, who were investigating the structure-activity relationships of the fentanyl family of drugs. They found that replacing the phenethyl group attached to the piperidine nitrogen of fentanyl with a smaller methyl group, made it so much weaker that it was inactive as an analgesic in animals. However the same change made to the more potent analogue carfentanil retained reasonable opioid receptor activity, reflecting the higher binding affinity produced by the 4-carbomethoxy group.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gardasil	Gardasil						injection		Gardasil, also known as Gardisil or Silgard, is a vaccine for use in the prevention of certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV), specifically HPV types 6, 11, 16 and 18. HPV types 16 and 18 cause an estimated 70% of cervical cancers, and are responsible for most HPV-induced anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancer cases. HPV types 6 and 11 cause an estimated 90% of genital warts cases. Though it does not treat existing infection, vaccination is still recommended for HPV positive individuals, as it may protect against one or more different strains of the disease. The HPV strains that Gardasil protects against are sexually transmitted. It was approved in the US on June 8, 2006 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA recommends vaccination before adolescence and potential sexual activity.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rotavirus_vaccine	Rotavirus vaccine						oral		A rotavirus vaccine protects children from rotaviruses, which are the leading cause of severe diarrhea among infants and young children. Each year an estimated 453,000 children die from diarrhoeal disease caused by rotavirus, most of whom live in developing countries, and another two million are hospitalised. Rotavirus is highly contagious and resistant and, regardless of water quality and available sanitation nearly every child in the world is at risk of infection. There are two effective rotavirus vaccines: Rotarix by GlaxoSmithKline and RotaTeq by Merck. On June 5, 2009, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that rotavirus vaccine be included in all national immunization programs. The Rotavirus Vaccine Program and the Accelerated Vaccine Introduction initiative have worked to study rotavirus vaccines among developing-country populations to assist developing countries in introducing rotavirus vaccines into routine immunization programs.

The vaccine also reduced by 66.5% the number of cases of postherpetic neuralgia and reduced the severity and duration of pain and discomfort associated with shingles, by 61.1%. Local reactions at the injection site were generally mild. Zostavax was approved and licensed by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2006. The FDA originally recommended it only for individuals 60 years of age or older who met the following requirements: Has not had a life-threatening allergic reaction to gelatin, the antibiotic neomycin, or other component of the herpes zoster vaccine. Does not have a weakened immune system due to HIV/AIDS or another disease or medications (such as steroids, radiation and chemotherapy) that affect the immune system. Does not have a history of cancer affecting the bone marrow or lymphatic system, such as leukemia or lymphoma. Does not have active, untreated tuberculosis. On October 25, 2006, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) voted to recommend that Zostavax be given to all adults age 60 and over, including those who have had a previous episode of shingles, and those who do not recall having had chickenpox, since more than 99% of Americans ages 40 and older have had chickenpox. On May 19, 2006, the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) issued a marketing authorisation for Zostavax to Sanofi Pasteur for routine vaccination in individuals aged 60 and over. And in 2007, updated the marketing authorisation for routine vaccination in individuals aged 50 and over. On March 24, 2011, the FDA approved Zostavax for individuals 50 to 59 years of age. The duration of protection beyond 4 years after vaccination with Zostavax is unknown. The need for re-vaccination has not been defined.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morphine/naltrexone	Morphine/naltrexone						Oral		The drug combination morphine/naltrexone (trade name Embeda) is a very strong pain medication developed by Alpharma Pharmaceuticals. The active ingredients are morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride; morphine being an opioid receptor agonist and naltrexone an opioid receptor antagonist. It is a schedule 2 controlled substance, intended for long-term pain caused by malignancy or where lower tiers of the pain management ladder have already been exhausted, and where medications such as oxycodone would otherwise be indicated. Embeda is formulated with morphine pellets and has an inner core containing naltrexone. The purpose of this formulation is to prevent people from crushing the tablet for intranasal administration or from injecting themselves. If it is crushed, the naltrexone would mix with the morphine and naltrexone would competitively antagonize the effects of morphine in the body. The inner core containing naltrexone is formulated so that if ingested orally, the core encapsulating the naltrexone would not be digested by the gastrointestinal tract.

This combination is registered for animal use only. To achieve efficacy, the treatment is administered once monthly, together with food, in a dosage suitable for the weight of the affected animal. The usual ratio is 500Â Âµg milbemycin oxime and 10Â mg lufenuron/kg body weight. Novartis indicates the proper dosage by color-coding the packages. Several 2002 studies by Novartis demonstrate that milbemycin oxime/lufenuron compares favorably to some other treatments, such as the moxidectin injection. The combination is considered effective in the elimination of fleas, and the prevention of infection from hookworm (Ancylostoma caninum), heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis), roundworms, whipworms (Trichuris vulpis), and ascarids. The USA FDA approval for Sentinel says ""Concurrent use of insecticides may be necessary"".

It was developed in the 1950s during research into analogues of pethidine and was assessed by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime but was not included on the list of drugs under international control, probably because it was not used in medicine or widely available. Propylketobemidone is so named because it is the propyl ketone analogue of bemidone (hydroxypethidine). The more commonly used ethyl ketone (""ethylketobemidone"") is simply called ketobemidone, as it is the only drug of this family to have been marketed. Presumably propylketobemidone produces similar effects to ketobemidone and other opioids, such as analgesia and sedation, along with side effects such as nausea, itching, vomiting and respiratory depression which may be harmful or fatal."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cholera_vaccine	Cholera vaccine								"Cholera vaccine is a vaccine used against cholera and traveler's diarrhea. The first vaccines used against cholera were developed in the late nineteenth century. These injected whole cell vaccine became increasingly popular until they were replaced by oral vaccines starting in the 1980s. Although no longer in use, the injected cholera vaccines are effective for people living where cholera is endemic. They offer significant degrees of protection for up to two years after a single shot, and for three to four years with annual booster. They reduce the risk of death from cholera by 50% in the first year after vaccination. There are two variants of the oral vaccine currently in use: WC-rBS and BivWC. WC-rBS (marketed as ""Dukoral"") is a monovalent inactivated vaccine containing killed whole cells of V. cholerae O1 plus additional recombinant cholera toxin B subunit. BivWC (marketed as ""Shanchol"" and ""mORCVAX"") is a bivalent inactivated vaccine containing killed whole cells of V. cholerae O1 and V. cholerae O139. mORCVAX is only available in Vietnam. These oral vaccines provide protection in 52% of cases the first year following vaccination and in 62% of cases the second year. Bacterial strains of both Inaba and Ogawa serotypes and of El Tor and Classical biotypes are included in the vaccine. Dukoral is taken orally with bicarbonate buffer, which protects the antigens from the gastric acid. The vaccine acts by inducing antibodies against both the bacterial components and CTB. The antibacterial intestinal antibodies prevent the bacteria from attaching to the intestinal wall thereby impeding colonisation of V. cholerae O1. The anti-toxin intestinal antibodies prevent the cholera toxin from binding to the intestinal mucosal surface thereby preventing the toxin-mediated diarrhoeal symptoms. Dukoral also protects against traveler's diarrhea. The cholera vaccine is largely used by backpackers and persons visiting locations where there is a high risk of cholera infection. However, since it does not provide 100% immunity from the disease, food hygiene precautions should also be taken into consideration when visiting an area where there is a high risk of becoming infected with cholera. Although the protection observed has been described as ""moderate"", herd immunity can multiply the effectiveness of vaccination. Dukoral has been licensed for children 2 years of age and older, Shanchol for children 1 year of age and older. The administration of the vaccine to adults confers additional indirect protection (herd immunity) to children."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methylisopropyllysergamide	Methylisopropyllysergamide								Methylisopropyllysergamide (lysergic acid methylisopropyl amide, MIPLA) is an analogue of LSD that was originally discovered by Albert Hofmann at Sandoz during the original structure-activity research into LSD. It has subsequently been investigated in more detail by the team led by David E. Nichols at Purdue University. Methylisopropyllysergamide is a structural isomer of LSD, with the alkyl groups on the amide nitrogen having been subjected to a methylene shuffle. MIPLA and its ethylisopropyl homologue are the only simple N,N-dialkyl lysergamides that approach the potency of LSD itself, being around 1/3-1/2 the potency of LSD, while all other dialkyl analogues tested (dimethyl, dipropyl, methylethyl etc. ) are only around 1/10 as potent as LSD, although some N-monoalkyl lysergamides such as the sec-butyl and t-butyl derivatives were also found to show an activity profile and potency comparable to LSD, and the mono-isopropyl derivative is only slightly weaker than MIPLA. Apart from its lower potency, the hallucinogenic effects of methylisopropyllysergamide are similar to those of LSD itself, and the main use for this drug has been in studies of the binding site at the 5-HT2A receptor through which LSD exerts most of its pharmacological effects.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/2CD-5EtO	2CD-5EtO								"2CD-5EtO is a homologue of the phenethylamine hallucinogen 2C-D, where the 5-methoxy group of 2C-D has been lengthened to an ethoxy group. 2CD-5EtO is a representative example of the so-called ""tweetio"" compounds discovered by Alexander Shulgin and briefly mentioned in his book PiHKAL, which are homologues of the 2C family of drugs, where either one or both of the methoxy groups at the 2,5- positions of the aromatic ring have been replaced by ethoxy. The term tweetio was derived phonetically from the sound of the ""2-ETO"" derivatives. A large number of tweetio derivatives of various 2C drugs have been synthesised and tested, including the 2-ethoxy homologues 2CD-2EtO, 2CB-2EtO, 2CI-2EtO, 2CT-2EtO, 2CT2-2EtO, 2CT4-2EtO and 2CT7-2EtO, the 5-ethoxy homologues 2CD-5EtO, 2CE-5EtO, 2CB-5EtO, 2CT-5EtO and 2CT2-5EtO, and the 2,5-diethoxy homologues 2CD-diEtO, 2CB-diEtO and 2CT2-diEtO. In general the 2-ethoxy homologues were all several times less potent and somewhat shorter acting than the parent compounds, while the 2,5-diethoxy homologues were far less potent and qualitatively milder even at high doses. The 5-ethoxy homologues however were of a similar potency to the parent compounds and much longer lasting, with both 2CE-5EtO and 2CT2-5EtO lasting 24 hours or more. At small doses, the 5-ethoxy homologues are reputed to produce weaker psychedelic effects, but with increased nootropic action, which might potentially make them useful as study aids."

Alder Wright in 1874 by adding two acetyl groups to the molecule morphine, found in the opium poppy. It is the 3,6-diacetyl ester of morphine, and functions as a morphine prodrug, meaning that it is metabolically converted to morphine inside the body in order for it to work. When used in medicine it is typically used to treat severe pain, such as that resulting from a heart attack or a severe injury. The name ""heroin"" is only used when being discussed in its illegal form. When it is used in a medical environment, it is referred to as diamorphine. The white crystalline form considered ""pure heroin"" is usually the hydrochloride salt, diacetylmorphine hydrochloride. Illicit heroin is usually in freebase form, dulling the sheen and consistency to a matte-white powder. Because of its lower boiling point, the freebase form of heroin is also smokable. It is prevalent in heroin coming from Afghanistan, which as of 2004 produced roughly 87% of the world supply in illicit raw opium. However, production in Mexico has risen six times from 2007 to 2011, changing that percentage and placing Mexico as the second largest opium producer in the world. Mexican cartels are also known to produce a third type of illicit heroin, commonly called black tar, which results from a simplified, quicker synthesis procedure and contains a high percentage of morphine derivates other than heroin, such as 6-monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM). As with other opioids, diacetylmorphine is used as both an analgesic and a recreational drug. Frequent and regular administration is associated with tolerance and physical dependence. Internationally, diacetylmorphine is controlled under Schedules I and IV of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs. It is illegal to manufacture, possess, or sell diacetylmorphine without a license in almost every country. Under the chemical names diamorphine and diacetylmorphine, heroin is a legally prescribed controlled drug in the United Kingdom, and is supplied in tablet or injectable form for the same indications as morphine is, often being preferred over morphine due to its lower side-effect profile. It is also available for prescription to long-term users as a form of opioid replacement therapy in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, and Denmark, alongside psycho-social careâ€”in the same manner that methadone or buprenorphine are used in the United States or Canadaâ€”and a similar programme is being campaigned for by liberal political parties in Norway."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imatinib	Imatinib	5291	DB00619	BKJ8M8G5HI	152459-95-5		Oral	Hepatic	Imatinib, marketed by Novartis as Gleevec (U.S. ) or Glivec (Europe/Australia/Latin America), is a competitive tyrosine-kinase inhibitor used in the treatment of multiple cancers, most notably Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph) chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Like all tyrosine-kinase inhibitors, imatinib works by preventing a central tyrosine kinase enzyme, in this case BCR-Abl, from phosphorylating subsequent proteins and initiating the signaling cascade necessary for cancer development, thus preventing the growth of cancer cells and leading to their death by apoptosis. Because the BCR-Abl tyrosine kinase enzyme exists only in cancer cells and not in healthy cells, imatinib works as a form of targeted therapyâ€”only cancer cells are killed through the drug's action. In this regard, imatinib was one of the first cancer therapies to show the potential for such targeted action, and is often cited as a paradigm for research in cancer therapeutics.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methylphenidate	Methylphenidate	4158	DB00422	207ZZ9QZ49	113-45-1		Oral, Transdermal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is a psychostimulant drug approved for treatment of ADHD or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome and narcolepsy. The original patent was owned by CIBA, now Novartis Corporation). It was first licensed by the FDA in 1955 for treating ADHD, prescribed from 1960, and became heavily prescribed in the 1990s, when the diagnosis of ADHD itself became more widely accepted. ADHD and some other conditions are believed to be linked to sub-performance of the dopamine, norepinephrine, and glutamate processes in the brain, primarily in the pre-frontal cortex and peripheral cortex, responsible for self-regulation functions, leading to self-regulation disorders compromising the sufferer's attention, self-control, behaviour, motivation, and executive function; methylphenidate primarily works by reducing the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine which improves the levels and utility of these neurotransmitters in the brain. Methylphenidate possesses some structural and pharmacological similarities to cocaine, though methylphenidate is less potent and longer in duration.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quinine	Quinine	8549	DB00468	A7V27PHC7A	130-95-0		Oral, intravenous	Hepatic	Quinine is a natural white crystalline alkaloid having antipyretic (fever-reducing), antimalarial, analgesic (painkilling), and anti-inflammatory properties and a bitter taste. It is a stereoisomer of quinidine which, unlike quinine, is an antiarrhythmic. Quinine contains two major fused-ring systems: the aromatic quinoline and the bicyclic quinuclidine. Though it has been synthesized in the laboratory, quinine occurs naturally in the bark of the cinchona tree. The medicinal properties of the cinchona tree were originally discovered by the Quechua, who are indigenous to Peru and Bolivia; later, the Jesuits were the first to bring cinchona to Europe. Quinine was the first effective treatment for malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum, appearing in therapeutics in the 17th century. It remained the antimalarial drug of choice until the 1940s, when other drugs such as chloroquine that have fewer unpleasant side effects replaced it. Since then, many effective antimalarials have been introduced, although quinine is still used to treat the disease in certain critical circumstances, such as severe malaria, and in impoverished regions due to its low cost. Quinine is available with a prescription in the United States and over-the-counter, in minute quantities, in tonic water. Quinine is also used to treat lupus and arthritis. Quinine was also frequently prescribed in the US as an off-label treatment for nocturnal leg cramps, but this has become less prevalent due to a Food and Drug Administration statement warning against the practice. Quinine is very sensitive to ultraviolet (UV) lightTemplate:How? and will fluoresce in direct sunlight due to its highly conjugated resonance structure.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Warfarin	Warfarin	6691	DB00682	5Q7ZVV76EI	81-81-2		Oral or intravenous	Hepatic: CYP2C9, 2C19, 2C8, 2C18, 1A2 and 3A4	"Warfarin (also known under the brand names Coumadin, Jantoven, Marevan, Lawarin, Waran, and Warfant) is an anticoagulant normally used in the prevention of thrombosis and thromboembolism, the formation of blood clots in the blood vessels and their migration elsewhere in the body respectively. It was initially introduced in 1948 as a pesticide against rats and mice and is still used for this purpose, although more potent poisons such as brodifacoum have since been developed. In the early 1950s warfarin was found to be effective and relatively safe for preventing thrombosis and embolism (abnormal formation and migration of blood clots) in many disorders. It was approved for use as a medication in 1954 and has remained popular ever since; warfarin is the most widely prescribed oral anticoagulant drug in North America. Despite its effectiveness, treatment with warfarin has several shortcomings. Many commonly used medications interact with warfarin, as do some foods (particularly leaf vegetable foods or ""greens,"" since these typically contain large amounts of vitamin K1) and its activity has to be monitored by blood testing for the international normalized ratio (INR) to ensure an adequate yet safe dose is taken. A high INR predisposes to a high risk of bleeding, while an INR below the therapeutic target indicates that the dose of warfarin is insufficient to protect against thromboembolic events. Warfarin and related 4-hydroxycoumarin-containing molecules decrease blood coagulation by inhibiting vitamin K epoxide reductase, an enzyme that recycles oxidized vitamin K1 to its reduced form after it has participated in the carboxylation of several blood coagulation proteins, mainly prothrombin and factor VII. Despite being labeled a vitamin K antagonist, warfarin does not antagonize the action of vitamin K1, but rather antagonizes vitamin K1 recycling, depleting active vitamin K1. Thus, the pharmacologic action may always be reversed by fresh vitamin K1. When administered, these drugs do not anticoagulate blood immediately. Instead, onset of their effect requires about a day before remaining active clotting factors have had time to naturally disappear in metabolism, and the duration of action of a single dose of warfarin is 2 to 5 days. Reversal of warfarin's effect when it is discontinued or vitamin K1 is administered, requires a similar time. Warfarin is a synthetic derivative of dicoumarol, a 4-hydroxycoumarin-derived mycotoxin anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover-based animal feeds. Dicoumarol, in turn, is derived from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found naturally in ""sweet"" clover (to which it gives its odor and name), tonka beans (also known as ""cumaru"" from which coumarin's name derives) and many other plants. The name warfarin stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym for the organization which funded the key research and the ending -arin, indicating its link with coumarin."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Testosterone	Testosterone	6013	DB00624	3XMK78S47O	58-22-0		Intramuscular injection, transdermal , sub-'Q' pellet	Liver, Testis and Prostate	Testosterone is a steroid hormone from the androgen group and is found in mammals, reptiles, birds, and other vertebrates. In mammals, testosterone is primarily secreted in the testicles of males and the ovaries of females, although small amounts are also secreted by the adrenal glands. It is the principal male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle, bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being as well as the prevention of osteoporosis. On average, in adult human males, the plasma concentration of testosterone is about 7â€“8 times as great as the concentration in adult human females' plasma, but as the metabolic consumption of testosterone in males is greater, the daily production is about 20 times greater in men. Females also are more sensitive to the hormone. Testosterone is observed in most vertebrates. Fish make a slightly different form called 11-ketotestosterone. Its counterpart in insects is ecdysone. These ubiquitous steroids suggest that sex hormones have an ancient evolutionary history.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dizocilpine	Dizocilpine	180081	?	7PY8KH681I	77086-21-6		Oral, IM	?	Dizocilpine, also known as MK-801, is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, a glutamate receptor discovered by a team at Merck in 1982. Glutamate is the brain's primary excitatory neurotransmitter. The channel is normally blocked with a magnesium ion and requires depolarization of the neuron to remove the magnesium and allow the glutamate to open the channel, causing an influx of calcium, which then leads to subsequent depolarization. MK-801 binds inside the ion channel of the receptor at several of PCP's binding sites thus preventing the flow of ions, including an influx of calcium (Ca), through the channel. Dizocilpine blocks NMDA receptors in a use- and voltage-dependent manner, since the channel must open for the drug to bind inside it. The drug acts as a potent anti-convulsant and likely has dissociative anesthetic properties, but it is not used clinically for this purpose due to the discovery of brain lesions, called Olney's lesions (see below), in test rats. MK-801 is also associated with a number of negative side effects, including cognitive disruption and psychotic-spectrum reactions. It also inhibited the induction of long term potentiation. Instead, the NMDA receptor pore-blocker ketamine is used as a dissociative anesthetic in human medical procedures. While ketamine may also trigger temporary psychosis in certain individuals, its short half-life and lower potency make it a much safer clinical option. However, dizocilpine is the most frequently used non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist in animal models to mimic psychosis for experimental purposes. Dizocilpine has also been found to act as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist. It has been shown to bind to and inhibit the serotonin and dopamine transporters as well.

It is commonly used for treating anxiety, panic attacks, insomnia, seizures including status epilepticus, muscle spasms (such as in cases of tetanus), restless legs syndrome, alcohol withdrawal, benzodiazepine withdrawal, Opiate withdrawal syndrome and MÃ©niÃ¨re's disease. It may also be used before certain medical procedures to reduce tension and anxiety, and in some surgical procedures to induce amnesia. It possesses anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, hypnotic, sedative, skeletal muscle relaxant, and amnestic properties. The pharmacological action of diazepam enhances the effect of the neurotransmitter GABA by binding to the benzodiazepine site on the GABAA receptor (via the constituent chlorine atom) leading to central nervous system depression. Adverse effects of diazepam include anterograde amnesia (especially at higher doses) and sedation, as well as paradoxical effects such as excitement, rage or worsening of seizures in epileptics. Benzodiazepines also can cause or worsen depression. Long-term effects of benzodiazepines such as diazepam include tolerance, benzodiazepine dependence and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome upon dose reduction. After cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist for at least six months and it was suggested that longer than six months may be needed for recovery from some deficits. Diazepam also has physical dependence potential and can cause serious problems of physical dependence with long term use. Compared to other benzodiazepines, though, physical withdrawal from diazepam following long term use is usually far more mild due to its long elimination half-life. Nevertheless, urgent action by national governments to improve prescribing practices has been recommended. Diazepam is the drug of choice for treating benzodiazepine dependence, with its low potency, long duration of action and the availability of low-dose tablets making it ideal for gradual dose reduction and the circumvention of withdrawal symptoms. Advantages of diazepam are a rapid onset of action and high efficacy rates, which is important for managing acute seizures, anxiety attacks and panic attacks; benzodiazepines also have a relatively low toxicity in overdose. Diazepam is a core medicine in the World Health Organization's ""Essential Drugs List"", which is a list of minimum medical needs for a basic health care system. Diazepam was first synthesized by Leo Sternbach, is used to treat a wide range of conditions, and has been one of the most frequently prescribed medications in the world since its launch in 1963."

This leads to decreased enterohepatic recirculation of bile acids, increased synthesis of new bile acids by the liver from cholesterol, decreased liver cholesterol, increased LDL receptor expression, and decreasing LDL in blood.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Diethylstilbestrol	Diethylstilbestrol	448537	DB00255	731DCA35BT	56-53-1		IV, oral		"Diethylstilbestrol (DES, former BAN stilboestrol) is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen that was first synthesized in 1938. It is also classified as an endocrine disruptor. Human exposure to DES occurred through diverse sources, such as dietary ingestion from supplemented cattle feed and medical treatment for certain conditions, including breast and prostate cancers. From about 1940 to 1970, DES was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause a rare vaginal tumor in girls and women who had been exposed to this drug in utero. The United States Food and Drug Administration subsequently withdrew DES from use in pregnant women. Follow-up studies have indicated DES also has the potential to cause a variety of significant adverse medical complications during the lifetimes of those exposed. The United States National Cancer Institute recommends women born to mothers who took DES undergo special medical exams on a regular basis to screen for complications as a result of the drug. Individuals who were exposed to DES during their mothers' pregnancies are commonly referred to as ""DES daughters"" and ""DES sons""."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tenocyclidine	Tenocyclidine	62751	DB01520	8BQ45Q6VCL	21500-98-1				Tenocyclidine (TCP) is a dissociative anesthetic drug with stimulant and hallucinogenic effects. It is similar in effects to phencyclidine (PCP) but is considerably more potent. TCP has slightly different binding properties to PCP, with more affinity for the NMDA receptors, but less affinity for the sigma receptors. Because of its high affinity for the PCP site of the NMDA receptor complex, the H radiolabelled form of TCP is widely used in research into NMDA receptors. TCP acts primarily as an NMDA receptor antagonist which blocks the activity of the NMDA receptor, however its increased stimulant effects compared to PCP suggests it also has relatively greater activity as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI). Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, TCP was placed into the Schedule I list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it was only briefly used in the 1970s and 1980s and is now little known.

It is also used in some conditioning regimens for bone marrow transplantation, kidney transplantation and Islet cell transplantation. Alemtuzumab binds to CD52, a protein present on the surface of mature lymphocytes, but not on the stem cells from which these lymphocytes are derived. After treatment with alemtuzumab, these CD52-bearing lymphocytes are targeted for destruction. Alemtuzumab is used as second-line therapy for CLL. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for CLL patients who have been treated with alkylating agents and who have failed fludarabine therapy. It has been approved by Health Canada for the same indication, and additionally for CLL patients who have not had any previous therapies. It is also used under clinical trial protocols for treatment of some autoimmune diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, in which it shows promise. Alemtuzumab was withdrawn from the markets in the US and Europe in 2012 to prepare for a higher-priced relaunch aimed at multiple sclerosis. A complication of therapy with alemtuzumab is that it significantly increases the risk for opportunistic infections, in particular, reactivation of cytomegalovirus.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azaperone	Azaperone	15443		19BV78AK7W	1649-18-9		intramuscular injection	hepatic	Azaperone (Stresnil, Fluoperidol) is a pyridinylpiperazine and butyrophenone neuroleptic drug with sedative and antiemetic effects, which is used mainly as a tranquilizer in veterinary medicine. It is used mainly in pigs and elephants. More rarely it may be used in humans as an antipsychotic drug, but this is uncommon. Use in horses is avoided as adverse reactions may occur. Azaperone acts primarily as a dopamine antagonist but also has some antihistaminic and anticholinergic properties as seen with similar drugs such as haloperidol. Azaperone may cause hypotension and while it has minimal effects on respiration in pigs, high doses in humans can cause respiratory depression which may be why it is rarely used in humans. The most common use for azaperone is in relatively small doses to reduce aggression in farmed pigs, either to stop them fighting or to encourage sows to accept piglets. Higher doses are used for anesthesia in combination with other drugs such as xylazine, tiletamine and zolazepam. Azaperone is also used in combination with strong narcotics such as etorphine or carfentanil for tranquilizing large animals such as elephants.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyamemazine	Cyamemazine	62865		A2JGV5CNU4	3546-03-0		Oral, IM, IV	Hepatic	Cyamemazine (Tercian), also known as cyamepromazine, is a typical antipsychotic drug of the phenothiazine class which was introduced by Theraplix in France in 1972 and later in Portugal as well. It is used for the treatment of schizophrenia and, especially, for psychosis-associated anxiety, due to its unique anxiolytic efficacy. Cyamemazine differs from other phenothiazine neuroleptics in that aside from the usual profile of dopamine, Î±1-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptor antagonism, it additionally produces potent blockade of several serotonin receptors, including 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, and 5-HT7. These actions have been implicated in cyamemazine's anxiolytic effects (5-HT2C) and lack of extrapyramidal side effects (5-HT2A), and despite being classified as a typical, it actually behaves like an atypical antipsychotic.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Erdosteine	Erdosteine	65632		76J0853EKA	84611-23-4		oral, inhalation	hepatic	Erdosteine is a mucolytic. Specifically it is a thiol derivative developed for the treatment of chronic obstructive bronchitis, including acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis. Erdosteine contains two blocked sulfhydryl groups which are released following first-pass metabolism. The three active metabolites exhibit mucolytic and free radical scavenging activity. Erdosteine modulates mucus production and viscosity and increases mucociliary transport, thereby improving expectoration. It also exhibits inhibitory activity against the effects of free radicals produced by cigarette smoke. Clinical studies in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease have demonstrated the efficacy and tolerability of erdosteine. Erdosteine 300 mg twice daily reduced cough (both frequency and severity) and sputum viscosity more quickly and more effectively than placebo and reduced the adhesivity of sputum more effectively than bromhexine 30 mg twice daily. Co-administration of erdosteine and amoxicillin in patients with acute infective exacerbation of chronic bronchitis resulted in higher concentrations of the antibiotic in the sputum, leading to earlier and more pronounced amelioration of clinical symptoms compared with placebo. Erdosteine is associated with a low incidence of adverse events, most of which are gastrointestinal and generally mild. The LD50 is very high, 3,500-5,000 mg/kg.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bicifadine	Bicifadine	47953		B0SV3N7J3H	71195-57-8		oral		"Bicifadine (DOV-220,075) is a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI) developed by DOV Pharmaceutical. It has been developed as an analgesic and is currently under development for the treatment of various pain conditions. Phase III trials were completed in 2006 for treating chronic low back pain, and the drug is currently being tested to assess its efficacy in treating pain associated with osteoarthritis, acute post-surgical pain, neuropathic pain and pain associated with dental surgery. http://www. dovpharm. com/sub_page/products_body. html Its usefulness in surgical or dental pain is dubious, however, as most monoamine uptake-inhibiting antidepressants have little if any effect in treating acute painâ€”they are only effective in cases of chronic neuropathic pain (much like their antidepressant properties, the analgesic properties of monoamine uptake inhibitors are not fully manifested until 1â€“2 weeks of continuous treatment). According to the ethymics website, Dov ran into difficulties in 2006 after bicifadine, a norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor, failed in Phase III for chronic lower back pain (see BioCentury, July 26, 2010). Bicifadine represents a novel class of drug using a non-opioid, non-NSAID mechanism for the treatment of pain, which should have less abuse potential than opioid drugs and less propensity to cause gastric ulcers than NSAID drugs. While the drug is purported to be a serotonin (SERT) and noradrenaline transporter (NET) inhibitor, it also has effects at the dopamine transporter (DAT), effectively making it a broad-spectrum monoamine transporter inhibitor or ""triple reuptake inhibitor. "" While its efficacy at the DAT is lower than its efficacy at either the SERT or the NET, it is still capable of increasing the perisynaptic concentration of all three monoamines. Bicifadine is not the first antidepressant drug used in the treatment of pain, as the older tricyclic antidepressants and the newer SNRI drug duloxetine have previously been approved for the treatment of neuropathic pain and disorders like fibromyalgia. Moreover, some weak or atypical opioid drugs such as tramadol and the newer agent tapentadol also function as noradrenaline reuptake inhibitors, a property that contributes to their overall therapeutic effect. Preliminary results suggest that bicifadine has an analgesic efficacy slightly stronger than codeine and approximately equivalent to tramadol, although side effects such as nausea and headache were more common with bicifadine than with tramadol. http://www. joacp. org/index. php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=58"

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eticyclidine	Eticyclidine	16622		O8I1LL6A89	2201-15-2				Eticyclidine (PCE, CI-400) is a dissociative anesthetic drug with hallucinogenic effects. It is similar in effects to phencyclidine but is slightly more potent. PCE was developed by Parke-Davis in the 1970s and evaluated for anesthetic potential under the code name CI-400, but research into PCE was not continued after the development of ketamine, a similar drug with more favourable properties. PCE is slightly more potent than PCP and has similar effects, but its unpleasant taste and tendency to cause nausea made it less accepted by users. Due to its similarity in effects to PCP, PCE was placed into the Schedule 1 list of illegal drugs in the 1970s, although it was only briefly abused in the 1970s and 1980s and is now little known.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abecarnil	Abecarnil	65914		IZM1PNJ3JL	111841-85-1				Abecarnil (ZK-112,119) is an anxiolytic drug from the Î²-Carboline family. It is one of a relatively recently developed class of medicines known as the nonbenzodiazepines, which have similar effects to the older benzodiazepine group, but with quite different chemical structures. It is a partial agonist acting selectively at the benzodiazepine site of the GABAA receptor. Abecarnil was originally developed as an anti-anxiety drug, but has not as yet been commercially developed for use in humans, instead so far mainly being used for research into the development of other new sedative and anxiolytic drugs. Investigations are continuing into its actions and it looks likely to be developed for use both in the treatment of anxiety, and as a less addictive substitute drug for the treatment of benzodiazepine and alcohol addiction. Abecarnil may also have less problems of tolerance and withdrawal problems compared to nonselective full agonist benzodiazepine acting drugs. Abecarnil is a relatively subtype-selective drug which produces primarily anxiolytic effects, with comparatively less sedative or muscle relaxant properties, and does not significantly potentiate the effects of alcohol. The abuse potential of abecarnil is thought to be less than that of benzodiazepines, with only mild withdrawal symptoms noted after abrupt discontinuation of treatment.

It is one of the constituents of althesin. It is used in veterinary practice under the tradename Alfaxan. It is licensed for use in both dogs and cats. Unlike some of its predecessors alfaxalone is not associated with histamine release and anaphylaxis. A study 1987 found the primary mechanism for the anaesthetic action of alfaxalone to be modulation of neuronal cell membrane chloride ion transport, induced by binding of alfaxalone to GABAA cell surface receptors. A 1994 study found that alfaxalone binds to a different region of this receptor than the benzodiazepines. Alfaxalone is metabolised rapidly in the liver. Alfaxalone has a very short plasma elimination half-life in dogs and cats.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bifeprunox	Bifeprunox	208951		AP69E83Z79	350992-10-8				"Bifeprunox (DU-127,090) is a novel atypical antipsychotic agent which, along with SLV313, aripiprazole, and SSR-181507 combines minimal D2 receptor agonism with 5-HT receptor agonism. Bifeprunox has a novel mechanism of action. Conventional antipsychotics are classed into typical and atypical. The typical antipsychotics, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol are potent D2 receptor antagonists. The atypical antipsychotics started with clozapine, these are classified as multireceptor interacting compounds, acting as an agonist towards 5-HT1A and an antagonist towards D2 receptors among other 5-HT and DA receptors. Bifeprunox and other novel atypical antipsychotics will instead of antagonizing D2 receptors, will act as partial agonists, as well as partial agonists towards 5-HT1A receptors. In a multi-center, placebo-controlled study, 20Â mg of bifeprunox was found to be significantly more effective than placebo at reducing symptoms of schizophrenia, with a low incidence of side effects. An NDA for Bifeprunox was filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in January 2007. The FDA rejected the application in August 2007. In June 2009, Solvay and Lundbeck decided to cease development because ""efficacy data did not support pursuing the existing development strategy of stabilisation of non-acute patients with schizophrenia."""

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cefsulodin	Cefsulodin	5284530		OV42LHE42B	52152-93-9				Cefsulodin is a third generation cephalosporin antibiotic that has very specific activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. It has no significant activity against other Gram-negative bacteria and very limited activity against Gram-positive bacteria and anaerobic bacteria. Cefsulodin was first synthesized and patented by the Takeda Pharmaceutical Company in 1977. In 2002, Takeda stopped production of Cefsulodin. Many years of low-stability cefsulodin production has led to a widespread reduction of laboratory and research usages. Current attempts of increasing purity and stability of cefsulodin center around recrystallization. Typically the process entails the following: Cefsulodin is dissolved in an organic solvent, sodium, water or any mixture thereof, then subsequently recrystallized through separation of the unwanted fraction. Recently, TOKU-E has found that the main cause of cefsulodin instability stems from one key impurity in 7-ACA (7-aminocephalosporanic acid- a raw material used in the synthesis of cefsulodin). In order to produce high-purity, high-stability cefsulodin, TOKU-E uses industrial HPLC to remove significant quantities of this impurity in 7-ACA and thus produces ultra-pure, ultra-stable, and ultra potent cefsulodin.

Its amino acid sequence is Pglu-Gln-Asp-Tyr[SO3H]-Thr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilnidipine	Cilnidipine	5282138		97T5AZ1JIP	132203-70-4				"Cilnidipine is a calcium channel blocker. It is sold as Atelec in Japan, as CILACAR (Cilnidipine 5mg, 10mg, 20mg) in India by JB CHEMICALS & PHARMACEUTICALS LTD. , since 2007. If you are in INDIA, ask for CILACAR. Cilnidipine is a dual blocker of L-type voltage-gated calcium channels in vascular smooth muscle and N-type calcium channels in sympathetic nerve terminals that supply blood vessels. However, the clinical benefits of cilnidipine and underlying mechanisms are incompletely understood. Clinidipine is the novel calcium antagonist accompanied with L-type and N-type calcium channel blocking function. It was jointly developed by Fuji Viscera Pharmaceutical Company, Japan and Ajinomoto, Japan and approved to come into market for the first time and used for high blood pressure treatment in 1995. Compared with other calcium antagonists, clinidipine can act on the N-type calcium-channel that existing sympathetic nerve end besides acting on L-type calcium-channel that similar to most of the calcium antagonists. Due to its N-type calcium-channel blocking properties, it has more advantages compared to conventional calcium-channel blockers. It has lower incidence of Pedal edema, one of the major adverse effects of other calcium channel blockers. Cilnidipine has similar blood pressure lowering efficacy as compared to amlodipine. One of the distinct property of cilnidipine from amlodipine is that it does not cause reflex tachycardia. CILNIDIPINE (Cilacar) ADVANTAGES OVER AMLODIPINE One of the main advantage of CILNIDIPINE is it REDUCES THE INCIDENCE OF PEDAL EDEMA UNLIKE AMLODIPINE L-type calcium channel blocker (Amlodipine) dilates the only arterioles & not the venules, hence blood pressure increases in the capillary bed and are thought to cause leg edema. CILNIDIPINE (Cilacar) due to its blocking action at N-type calcium channel dilates both arteriole & venules as a result the pressure in the capillary bed is reduces. The accumulated fluid in the tissues flows back to veins & thus Cilacar minimizes the incidence of pedal edema. Superior Clinical Benefits Cilnidipine controls hypertension for 24 hours with once daily dose. Cilnidipine has enhanced lipophilicity leading to prolonged antihypertensive effect correlated with occupancy of the binding site. In 24 hour clinical assessment, once-daily administration of cilnidipine (5â€“20 mg) produced BP reduction for 24 hour period. This indicates that once-daily cilnidipine exerts a sufficient and prolonged reduction of BP.2 Cilnidipine has 50 times higher selectivity for N-type of calcium channels than amlodipine. The inhibitory effect on the N-type Ca2+channel may bestow an additional clinical advantage for the treatment of hypertension, such as suppression of reflex tachycardia.3 As catecholamines induce platelet activation via alpha 2-receptors on platelet membrane, decrease in norepinephrine level by cilnidipine (absent in amlodipine) causes attenuation of platelet activation. Cilnidipine significantly decreased urinary albumin excretion without affecting serum creatinine concentration in hypertensive patients.11 Cilnidipine is superior to amlodipine in preventing the progression of proteinuria in patients with hypertension and chronic renal disease.1 Cilnidipine suppresses the development of proteinuria greater than amlodipine through inhibiting N-type calcium channel-dependent podocyte injury.12 Cilnidipine leads to less activation of the RAS compared with amlodipine for the first time in human clinical patients and therefore cilnidipine might be expected to be superior in organ protection in addition to the antialbuminuric effect.13 Cilnidipine inhibits proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells through inhibition of DNA/ RNA synthesis induced by growth-promoting factors released during atherosclerosis.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cilomilast	Cilomilast	151170		8ATB1C1R6X	153259-65-5				Cilomilast (Ariflo, SB-207,499) is a drug which was developed for the treatment of respiratory disorders such as asthma and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). It is orally active and acts as a selective Phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors, such as theophylline, have been used to treat Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) for centuries; however, the clinical benefits of these agents have never been shown to out-weigh the risks of their numerous adverse effects. Four clinical trials were identified evaluating the efficacy of cilomilast, the usual randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled protocols were used. It showed reasonable efficacy for treating COPD, but side effects were problematic and it is unclear whether cilomalast will be marketed, or merely used in the development of newer drugs. Cilomilast is a second-generation PDE4 inhibitor with antiinflammatory effects that target bronchoconstriction, mucus hypersecretion, and airway remodeling associated with COPD.

The corticorelin stimulation test helps to differentiate between the etiologies of ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism. It is used to evaluate the status of the pituitary-adrenal axis in the differentiation of a pituitary source from an ectopic source of excessive ACTH secretion. If corticorelin injection increases plasma levels of ACTH and cortisol, a diagnosis of Cushing's disease is achieved (ACTH of pituitary origin). If corticorelin injection leads to little or no response in plasma levels of ACTH or cortisol, a diagnosis of Ectopic ACTH syndrome is confirmed.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cycloguanil	Cycloguanil	9049		26RM326WVN	516-21-2				Cycloguanil is a dihydrofolate reductase inhibitor, and is a metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil; its formation in vivo has been thought to be primarily responsible for the antimalarial activity of proguanil. However, more recent work has indicated that, while proguanil is synergistic with the drug atovaquone (as in the combination Malarone), cycloguanil is in fact antagonistic to the effects of atovaquone, suggesting that, unlike cycloguanil, proguanil may have an alternative mechanism of antimalarial action besides dihydrofolate reductase inhibition. Although cycloguanil is not currently in general use as an antimalarial, the continuing development of resistance to current antimalarial drugs has led to renewed interest in studying the use of cycloguanil in combination with other drugs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Faxeladol	Faxeladol	9813414		C04V6SGK8H	433265-65-7				Faxeladol is an opioid analgesic. It is related to tramadol and ciramadol. Just like tramadol, it is believed faxeladol would have pain-relieving, and potent anti-depressant effects, due to its action on serotonin and noradrenaline. Faxeladol is not currently used medically anywhere in the world. It was developed shortly after tramadol in the late 1970s. In various studies in the 1970s alongside tramadol, faxeladol was seen to be slightly more potent than tramadol, but with a higher rate of sudden seizures than tramadol. Tramadol itself is known to cause sudden seizures without warning in some users.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fosazepam	Fosazepam	37114		13AK3H33SG	35322-07-7				Fosazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative; it is a water soluble salt of diazepam. It has sedative and anxiolytic effects, and is a derivative of diazepam which has been substituted with a dimethylphosphoryl group to improve solubility in water. Fosazepam has similar effects on sleep as other benzodiazepines. In a clinical trial it was reported that fosazepam to lead to increased sleep duration with less broken sleep but sleep quality was worsened with suppressed deep sleep and increased light sleep. Adverse effects included feelings of impaired morning vitality and upon discontinuing the drug benzodiazepine withdrawal symptoms of anxiety, impaired concentration and impaired morning vitality were experienced. Another clinical trial also found worsening of sleep while on benzodiazepines as well as during withdrawal with suppression of deep sleep stages including REM sleep, with increased light sleep upon withdrawal. The main metabolites of fosazepam are 3-hydroxyfosazepam and the active metabolite desmethyldiazepam which has a very long elimination half-life of about 3 days. Tolerance to the hypnotic effects of fosazepam starts to develop after about 7 days of use. Due to the very long elimination half-life of the active metabolite of fosazepam it is not recommended for use as a hypnotic. The main pharmacological effects of fosazepam may be due to its metabolite nordiazepam (desmethyldiazepam), rather than the parent drug. The long-acting active metabolite nordazepam can cause extended sedative effects at high doses or with prolonged use, and may produce residual sedation upon awakening. Fosazepam is of relatively low potency compared to other benzodiazepine derivatives, with a 100Â mg dose of fosazepam equivalent to 10Â mg of nitrazepam. 60Â mg of fosazepam has also been estimated to be equivalent to about 5 â€“ 10Â mg of diazepam. Fosazepam has similar effects to nitrazepam, but with a shorter duration of action and less tendency to cause over sedation, motor-impairment, amnesia, rebound insomnia, and morning grogginess.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adipiplon	Adipiplon			OPL214POJ1	840486-93-3		Oral		Adipiplon (NG2-73) is an anxiolytic drug developed by Neurogen Corporation. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. Adipiplon is a subtype-selective GABAA receptor partial agonist, which binds preferentially to the Î±3 subtype. This is significant as while several previous nonbenzodiazepine drugs have been developed that are selective for Î±2/3 over the other subtypes, adipiplon is one of the first drugs selected for clinical development which is able to discriminate between Î±2 and Î±3, as well as showing little affinity for the Î±1 or Î±5 subtypes - alpidem is selective for Î±3 over Î±2, but still has moderate affinity for Î±1, whereas adipiplon is highly Î±3-selective with little affinity for either Î±1, Î±2 or Î±5. Adipiplon is being researched as a potential medication for the treatment of anxiety and insomnia, and is currently (as of 2008) in Phase IIb trials.

SalvinorinÂ A is considered a dissociative exhibiting atypically psychedelic effects. It is structurally distinct from other naturally occurring hallucinogens because it contains no nitrogen atoms; hence, it is not an alkaloid (and cannot be rendered as a salt) but a terpenoid. It also differs in subjective experience, compared to other hallucinogens, and has been described as dissociative, dysphoric, and diaphoretic. Salvinorin A can produce psychoactive experiences in humans with a typical duration of action being several minutes to an hour or so, depending on the method of ingestion. Salvinorin A is found with several other structurally related salvinorins. Salvinorin is a trans-neoclerodane diterpenoid. It acts as a kappa opioid receptor agonist and is the first known compound acting on this receptor that is not an alkaloid. Its pharmacological mechanism was elucidated in the laboratory of Bryan L.

It is structurally distinct from other naturally occurring hallucinogens because it contains no nitrogen atoms; hence, it is not an alkaloid (and cannot be rendered as a salt) but a terpenoid. It also differs in subjective experience, compared to other hallucinogens, and has been described as dissociative, dysphoric, and diaphoretic. Salvinorin A can produce psychoactive experiences in humans with a typical duration of action being several minutes to an hour or so, depending on the method of ingestion. Salvinorin A is found with several other structurally related salvinorins. Salvinorin is a trans-neoclerodane diterpenoid. It acts as a kappa opioid receptor agonist and is the first known compound acting on this receptor that is not an alkaloid. Its pharmacological mechanism was elucidated in the laboratory of Bryan L. Roth.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-Methyl-MDA	5-Methyl-MDA	10012829			749191-14-8		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		5-Methyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (5-Methyl-MDA) is an entactogen and psychedelic drug of the amphetamine class. It is a ring-methylated derivative of MDA and a structural isomer of MDMA. Drug discrimination studies showed that 5-methyl-MDA substitutes for MDA, MMAI, and LSD, but not amphetamine, suggesting that it produces a mix of entactogen and hallucinogenic effects without any stimulant effects. 5-Methyl-MDA acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) with IC50 values of 107nM, 11,600nM, and 1,494nM for serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine efflux. It is over 5x more potent than MDA, with a suitable active dose possibly being around 15â€“25Â mg. 2-Methyl-MDA is also much more potent than MDA, but is not quite as potent as 5-methyl-MDA. Both 6-methyl-MDA and 6-methyl-MDMA (also known as Madam-6) are inactive, likely due to steric hindrance. Recent research has used data on 2-methyl-MDA and 5-methyl-MDA to help guide computer modeling of the serotonin transporter complex. The synthesis of 5-methyl-MDA can be found online.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Akuammine	Akuammine	6441511			3512-87-6		Oral, Rectal		"Akuammine, an indole alkaloid also known as vincamajoridine, is the most abundant active alkaloid found in the seeds from the tree Picralima nitida, commonly known as Akuamma. The dried seeds from this plant are used in traditional medicine throughout West Africa, particularly in Ghana as well as in the Ivory Coast and Nigeria. The seeds are crushed or powdered and taken orally, and are mainly used for the treatment of malaria and diarrhoea, and as a painkiller. An enterprising Ghanaian hospital started manufacturing standardised 250Â mg capsules of the powdered P. nitida seed, and sold them around the country where they became widely accepted as a safe and effective pain relief product. This then led researchers to try to discover the active component of the seeds. P. nitida seeds contain a mixture of alkaloids producing antipyretic and antiinflammatory effects along with analgesia. Several of these were shown to bind to opioid receptors in vitro, and two compounds, akuammidine and Ïˆ-akuammigine, were found to be potent Î¼-opioid agonists, although not particularly selective. Surprisingly the main alkaloid from the seeds, akuammine, was found to be an opioid antagonist when tested in vitro and canceled out the effects of the active agonist components. Given the confirmed activity of the whole seed extract in humans, this makes it likely that akuammine is in fact being metabolised once inside the body to form a metabolite acting as an opioid receptor agonist. Akuammine is the main alkaloid found in the seeds, comprising 0.56% of the dried powder, indicating that the 250Â mg ""Picap Capsules"" sold commercially should contain approximately 1.4Â mg of akuammine, plus 0.085Â mg akuammidine and 0.015Â mg Ïˆ-akuammigine. Akuammine is structurally related to both yohimbine and mitragynine, both of which are alkaloid plant products with uses in medicine."

It has analgesic, diuretic and antitussive effects, and reverses the memory impairment produced by anticholinergic drugs. U-50488 was one of the first selective kappa agonists invented and research on its derivatives has led to the development of a large family of related compounds.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-HO-MPMI	4-HO-MPMI	10466404			250672-65-2				4-HO-MPMI (also known as 4-Hydroxy-N-methyl-tryptamine or lucigenol) is a tryptamine derivative that is a hallucinogenic drug. It was developed by the team led by David Nichols from Purdue University in the late 1990s. This compound produces hallucinogen-appropriate responding in animal tests with a similar potency to the amphetamine derived hallucinogen DOI, and has two enantiomers, with only the (R)-enantiomer being active. The binding affinity for 5-HT2A receptor is 13 +/- 2 nM (Ki DOI). It is reported at doses starting at 0.5Â mg and 1.0-1.5Â mg seem to be psychedelic doses. The duration it is reported between six to eight hours. The effects, still not too documented, are OEV/CEV, sedation and anxiety.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-Carboxamidotryptamine	5-Carboxamidotryptamine	1809			74885-09-9				5-Carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) is a tryptamine derivative closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin. 5-CT acts as a non-selective, high-affinity full agonist at the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, 5-HT1D, 5-HT5A, and 5-HT7 receptors, as well as at the 5-HT2, 5-HT3, 5-HT6 receptors with lower affinity. It has negligible affinity for the 5-HT1E and 5-HT1F receptors. 5-CT binds strongest to the 5-HT1A receptor and it was once thought to be selective for this site.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-Fluoro-AMT	5-Fluoro-AMT	12834			712-08-3				5-Fluoro-Î±-methyltryptamine (5-Fluoro-Î±MT) is a tryptamine derivative. It is similar in structure to hallucinogenic tryptamines such as Î±MT and 5-MeO-Î±MT. 5-Fluoro-Î±MT has been found to act as a potent and selective MAO-A inhibitor, and also as a 5HT2A receptor agonist. It produces a strong head-twitch response in mice, and this effect is known to correlate with hallucinogenic effects in humans, which suggests that 5-Fluoro-Î±MT would be an active hallucinogen in humans, although it is not known to have been tested in humans and could potentially be dangerous due to its strong inhibition of MAO-A.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-I-R91150	5-I-R91150	132997			155928-24-8				5-I-R91150 (or R93274) is a compound that acts as a potent and selective antagonist of 5-HT2A receptors. Its main application is as its iodine-123 radiolabeled form, in which it can be used in SPECT scanning in human neuroimaging studies, to examine the distribution of the 5-HT2A receptor subtype in the brain, e.g. with respect to sex and age and in adults with Asperger syndrome or Alzheimer's disease. An alternative 5-HT2A receptor ligand also used in neuroimaging is altanserin.

It was first developed by the team led by JE Macor in 1992, and subsequently investigated by the team led by David Nichols from Purdue University in the late 1990s. This compound produces hallucinogen-appropriate responding in animal tests with a similar potency to the amphetamine derived hallucinogen DOI, and has two enantiomers, with only the (R)-enantiomer being active.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alphamethadol	Alphamethadol	62709			17199-54-1				Alphamethadol, or Î±-methadol, also known as alfametadol, is a synthetic opioid analgesic. It is an isomer of dimepheptanol (methadol), the other being betamethadol (Î²-methadol). Alphamethadol is composed of two isomers itself, -Î±-methadol, and -Î±-methadol. The former compound, -Î±-methadol, is an important active metabolite of levacetylmethadol (LAAM), an opioid substitute drug that is used clinically. Both of alphamethadol's isomers bind to and activate the Î¼-opioid receptor and are active as opioid analgesics, similarly to those of alphacetylmethadol (Î±-acetylmethadol).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Antalarmin	Antalarmin	177990			157284-96-3				Antalarmin is a drug that acts as a CRF-1 antagonist. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), also known as Corticotropin-releasing hormone, is an endogenous peptide hormone released in response to various triggers such as chronic stress and drug addiction. This, then, triggers the release of corticotropin (ACTH), another hormone involved in the physiological response to stress. Chronic release of CRF and ACTH is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in many of the harmful physiological effects of chronic stress, such as excessive glucocorticoid release, stomach ulcers, anxiety, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, depression, and development of high blood pressure and consequent cardiovascular problems. Antalarmin is a non-peptide drug that blocks the CRF-1 receptor, and, as a consequence, reduces the release of ACTH in response to chronic stress. This has been demonstrated in animals to reduce the behavioural responses to stressful situations, and it is proposed that antalarmin itself, or more likely newer CRF antagonist drugs still under development, could be useful for reducing the adverse health consequences of chronic stress in humans, as well as having possible uses in the treatment of conditions such as anxiety, depression, and drug addiction. Results so far have had limited success, with various CRF antagonists being tested, which showed some antidepressant effects, but failed to produce an effect comparable with conventional antidepressant drugs. However more positive results were seen when antalarmin was combined with an SSRI antidepressant, suggesting a potential for synergistic effect. Encouraging results have also been observed using antalarmin as a potential treatment for anxiety and stress-induced hypertension. Chronic antalarmin treatment also showed anti-inflammatory effects and has been suggested as having potential uses in the treatment of inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, as well as stress-induced gastrointestinal ulcers and irritable bowel syndrome. Mixed results have been seen in research into the use of antalarmin and other CRF-1 antagonists in the treatment of drug addiction disorders. Tests of antalarmin on cocaine use in cocaine-addicted monkeys produced only slight reductions of use that were not statistically significant, however in tests on cocaine-addicted rats, antalarmin did prevent dose escalation with prolonged use, suggesting that it might stabilise cocaine use and prevent it increasing over time, although without consistently reducing it. Antalarmin also showed positive effects in reducing withdrawal syndrome from chronic opioid use, and significantly reduced self-administration of ethanol in ethanol-addicted rodents.

It is around 5x more potent a stimulant than cocaine, but is relatively unselective, binding to all three monoamine transporters although still with some selectivity for the dopamine transporter. RTI-126 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its pharmacological profile in animals is among the closest to cocaine itself out of all the drugs in the RTI series. Its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with its rapid entry into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals. It is interesting to note that the structurally related compound (-)-2Î²-(3-methyl-5-isoxazolyl)nortropane is a potent and selective agonist for nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, with twice the potency of nicotine.

It is a structural analogue of sildenafil (Viagra) which has been detected in numerous different brands of supposedly ""herbal"" aphrodisiac products sold to boost libido and alleviate erectile dysfunction. A range of designer analogues of licensed PDE5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and vardenafil have been detected in recent years in over-the-counter herbal aphrodisiac products, in an apparent attempt to circumvent both the legal restrictions on sale of erectile dysfunction drugs, which are prescription-only medicines in most Western countries, and the patent protection which allows sale of these drugs by competitors only with permission from the patent holders (typically, under a license from the inventors). These compounds have been demonstrated to display PDE5 inhibitory activity in vitro and presumably have similar effects when consumed, but have undergone no formal testing in either humans or animals, and as such may represent significant health risks to consumers of these products due to their unknown safety profile. Some attempts have been made to ban these drugs as unlicensed medicines, but progress has been slow so far, as even in those jurisdictions which have laws targeting designer drugs, the laws are drafted to ban analogues of illegal drugs of abuse, rather than analogues of prescription medicines. However at least one court case has resulted in a product being taken off the market."

It binds to the dopamine transporter with around 20x the affinity of cocaine, however it produces relatively mild stimulant effects, with a slow onset and long duration of action. These characteristics make it a potential candidate for treatment of cocaine addiction, as a possible substitute drug analogous to how methadone is used for treating heroin abuse. RTI-336 fully substitutes for cocaine in addicted monkeys and supports self-administration, and significantly reduces rates of cocaine use, especially when combined with SSRIs, and research is ongoing to determine whether it could be a viable substitute drug in human cocaine addicts.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/14-Phenylpropoxymetopon	14-Phenylpropoxymetopon	10238204							14-Phenylpropoxymetopon (PPOM) is an opiate analogue that is a derivative of metopon which has been substituted with a Î³-phenylpropoxy group at the 14-position. It is a highly potent analgesic drug several thousand times stronger than morphine, with a similar in vivo potency to etorphine. The 14-phenylpropoxy substitution appears to confer potent Î¼-opioid agonist activity, even when combined with substitutions such as N-cyclopropyl or N-allyl, which normally result in Î¼-opioid antagonist compounds. It has never been used in humans, but would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal. Tolerance and dependence would be expected to develop rapidly based on the potency of the drug, as it is of a similar strength to the potent fentanyl analogues and so would most likely cause pronounced tachyphylaxis following repeated dosing.

It is the first drug developed that is a highly selective agonist for the D4 subtype, with significantly improved selectivity over older D4-preferring compounds such as PD-168,077 and CP-226,269. In animal tests it improved cognitive performance in rats to a similar extent as methylphenidate, but without producing place preference or other signs of abuse liability. Also unlike other dopamine agonists, selective D4 agonists do not cause side effects such as sedation and nausea, and so might have advantages over older dopamine agonist drugs.

It has subnanomolar affinity for the H3 receptor and selectivity of over 10,000x for H3 over other histamine receptor subtypes. Animal studies have shown it to possess not only stimulant and nootropic effects, but also analgesic action suggesting a role for H3 receptors in pain processing in the spinal cord. GSK-189,254 and several other related drugs are currently being investigated as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, as well as possible use in the treatment of conditions such as narcolepsy, or neuropathic pain which do not respond well to conventional analgesic drugs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/TGN1412	TGN1412						http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		"TGN1412 (also known as CD28-SuperMAB) is the working name of an immunomodulatory drug which was withdrawn from development after inducing severe inflammatory reactions in the first-in-man study in London in March 2006. The developing company, TeGenero Immuno Therapeutics, entered into insolvency proceedings later that year. Originally intended for the treatment of B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) and rheumatoid arthritis, TGN1412 is a humanised monoclonal antibody that not only binds to, but is a strong agonist for, the CD28 receptor of the immune system's T cells. CD28 is the co-receptor for the T cell receptor; It binds to receptors on the interacting partner in the reaction through one of its ligands (B7 family). In its first human clinical trials, it caused catastrophic systemic organ failure in the subjects, despite being administered at a supposed sub-clinical dose of 0.1Â mg per kg; some 500 times lower than the dose found safe in animals. Six volunteers were hospitalized on 13 March 2006, at least four of these suffering from multiple organ dysfunction. Tentative opinions from an as-yet uncompleted inquiry suggest that the problems resulted from ""unforeseen biological action in humans"", rather than breach of trial protocols, and the case therefore has had important ramifications for future trials of potentially powerful clinical agents. Scientists in early 2007 put forth the theory that the drug acted in a different fashion in humans as compared with the laboratory animals in which the drug was first tried. The severe reactions in humans could have only occurred, they believe, in animals with memory T lymphocytes. Animals raised in a sterile lab would presumably have no 'memory' of previous illnesses, thus would not exhibit the severe reactions that occurred in the human subjects. However this is a misunderstanding of the research: the research says that non-human animals studied have fewer memory T cells than humans, and that stimulation through the CD28 receptor alone in memory T cells causes them to infiltrate organs and also activates them. The drug, which was designated as an orphan medical product by the European Medicines Agency in March 2005, was developed by TeGenero Immuno Therapeutics, tested by Parexel and manufactured by Boehringer-Ingelheim. TeGenero announced the first elucidation of the molecular structure of CD28 almost exactly one year prior to commencement of the TGN1412 phase I clinical trial."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lymecycline	Lymecycline	24757945	DB00256	7D6EM3S13P	992-21-2		oral	?	Lymecycline is a tetracycline broad-spectrum antibiotic marketed by the pharmeceutical company Galderma. It is approximately 5,000 times more soluble than tetracycline base and is unique amongst tetracyclines in that it is absorbed by an active transport process across the intestinal wall, making use of the same fast and efficient mechanism by which carbohydrates are absorbed. The greater absorption of lymecycline allows for lower dosages to be used; the standard dose of 408Â mg is equivalent to 300Â mg tetracycline base, and in its action to 500Â mg tetracycline hydrochloride. Lymecycline, unlike tetracycline hydrochloride, is soluble at all physiological pH values.

Perhexiline is thought to act by inhibiting mitochondrial carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1. This shifts myocardial metabolism from fatty acid to glucose utilisation which results in increased ATP production for the same O2 consumption and consequently increases myocardial efficiency. Its clinical use has been limited by its narrow therapeutic index and high inter- and intra-individual pharmacokinetic variability. It was outlawed in many countries due to its adverse effects on poor metabolisers (PM). The product has been reintroduced for patients who have contraindications, or have not responded to, other treatments for angina.

The FDA approved it October 20, 2003, while the EMEA approved it on July 12, 2004. The human body metabolizes fosamprenavir in order to form amprenavir, which is the active ingredient. That metabolization increases the duration that amprenavir is available, making fosamprenavir a slow-release version of amprenavir and thus reducing the number of pills required versus standard amprenavir. A head-to-head study with lopinavir showed the two drugs to have comparable potency, but patients on fosamprenavir tended to have a higher serum cholesterol. Fosamprenavir's main advantage over lopinavir is that it is cheaper.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inosine	Inosine	6021	DB04566	5A614L51CT	58-63-9			http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Inosine is a nucleoside that is formed when hypoxanthine is attached to a ribose ring (also known as a ribofuranose) via a Î²-N9-glycosidic bond. Inosine is commonly found in tRNAs and is essential for proper translation of the genetic code in wobble base pairs. Knowledge of inosine metabolism has led to advances in immunotherapy in recent decades. Inosine monophosphate is oxidised by the enzyme inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, yielding xanthosine monophosphate, a key precursor in purine metabolism. Mycophenolate mofetil is an anti-metabolite, anti-proliferative drug that acts as an inhibitor of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase. It is used in the treatment of a variety of autoimmune diseases including Wegener's granulomatosis because the uptake of purine by actively dividing B cells can exceed 8 times that of normal body cells, and, therefore, this set of white cells (which cannot operate purine salvage pathways) is selectively targeted by the purine deficiency resulting from IMD inhibition.

Equilin is one of the estrogens present in the mixture of estrogens isolated from horse urine and marketed as Premarin. Premarin became the most commonly used form of estrogen for hormone replacement therapy in the United States of America. Estrone is the major estrogen in Premarin (about 50%) and equilin is present as about 25% of the total. Estrone is a major estrogen that is normally found in women. Equilin is not normally present in women, so there has been interest in the effects of equilin on the human body. The estrogens in Premarin are present mainly as ""conjugates"", modified chemical forms in which the active estrogen is coupled to another chemical group such as sulfate. Estrone sulfate is usually the major form of estrogen in women. After being taken into a woman's body, the conjugated estrogens of Premarin are converted to the active unconjugated estrogens or excreted from the woman's body. Estrone can be converted to estradiol, which is thought to be the major active estrogen in women."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etonitazene	Etonitazene	13493	DB01462	9U3GT3353T	911-65-9				Etonitazene is a potent analgesic drug shown to be approximately 1000â€“1500x the potency of morphine in animal models but only 60x morphine in man. It is one of several benzimidazole opioids, and is structurally related to clonitazene (where the p-ethoxybenzyl group is replaced by a p-chlorobenzyl group. However, clonitazene itself has only 3x the potency of morphine.). It has a strong dependency potential similar to that of morphine, and a strong tendency to produce respiratory depression, and is therefore not used in humans. It is however useful in addiction studies on animals. It is often used in studies requiring the animals to drink or ingest the opiate because it is not as bitter as the opiate salts, i.e. , morphine sulfate. It is the most potent benzimidazole opioid currently known. Other analogues of considerable potency are as follows: Of these analogues, only etonitazene and clonitazene are explicitly listed as illegal drugs under UN convention and so are illegal throughout the world. The rest would only be illegal in countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act. Etonitazene has proved very important in mapping out the opiate receptor and some experimental compounds in which phenolic groupings have been replaced with nitro groupings have proved more active than the parent compound. Illicit production and sale of etonitazene has been limited. This compound was identified on the illegal drug market in Moscow in 1998, appeared to have been illicitly manufactured, and was primarily smoked as pre-laced cigarettes. In another case a chemist at Morton Thiokol called Thomas K Highsmith produced the compound and placed it in a nasal inhaler.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Denileukin_diftitox	Denileukin diftitox		DB00004	25E79B5CTM	173146-27-5		Intravenous		Denileukin diftitox (trade name Ontak) is an antineoplastic agent, an engineered protein combining Interleukin-2 and Diphtheria toxin. This can bind to Interleukin-2 receptors and introduce the diphtheria toxin into cells that express those receptors, killing the cells. In some Leukemias and Lymphomas malignant cells express these receptors, so denileukin diftitox can target these. In 1999 Ontak was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for treatment of Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL). A recent study at the University of Louisville found the drug caused many stage IV cutaneous T-cell lympomas to regress or stabilize extending patient life expectancy from about eight months to more than a year; a clinically significant increase especially given the guarded prognosis of patients with advanced disseminated cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) and the generally poor response to other available treatments.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alcuronium_chloride	Alcuronium chloride	5311001		490DW6501Y	23214-96-2			not metabolized	Alcuronium is a neuromuscular blocking (NMB) agent, alternatively referred to as a skeletal muscle relaxant. It is a semi-synthetic substance prepared from C-toxiferine I, a bis-quaternary alkaloid obtained from Strychnos toxifera. C-toxiferine I itself has been tested for its pharmacological action and noted to be a very long acting neuromuscular blocking agent For a formal definition of the durations of actions associated with NMB agents, see page for gantacurium. The replacement of both the N-methyl groups with N-allyl moieties yielded N,N-diallyl-bis-nortoxiferine, now recognized as alcuornium (and at one time marketed as the proprietary agent called Alloferin). Inclusion of the allylic functions presented an enhanced potential area of biotransformation, and thus alcuronium is observed to have a much shorter duration of neuromuscular blocking action than its parent C-toxiferine I. It also has a more rapid onset of action, and is ~1.5 times as potent as tubocurarine. The pharmacological action of alcuronium is readily reversed by neostigmine, and it produced little histamine release. The major disadvantage of alcuronium is that it elicits a vagolytic effect produced by a selective atropoine-like blockade of cardiac muscarinic receptors.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mizoribine	Mizoribine	104762		4JR41A10VP	50924-49-7		Oral		Mizoribine (INN, trade name Bredinin) is an immunosuppressive drug. The compound was first observed in Tokyo, Japan, in 1971. It is a natural product, first isolated from the mould Eupenicillium brefeldianum. Mizoribine (MZB) is an imidazole nucleoside that has been used in renal transplantation, and in steroid-resistant nephrotic syndrome, IgA nephropathy, lupus, as well as for adults with rheumatoid arthritis, lupus nephritis and other rheumatic diseases. MZB exerts its activity through selective inhibition of inosine monophosphate synthetase and guanosine monophosphate synthetase, resulting in the complete inhibition of guanine nucleotide synthesis without incorporation into nucleotides. It arrests DNA synthesis in the S phase of cellular division. Thus, MZB has less toxicity than azathioprine, another immunosuppressant used for some of the same diseases.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Proglumide	Proglumide	4922		EPL8W5565D	6620-60-6		Oral		Proglumide (Milid) is a drug that inhibits gastrointestinal motility and reduces gastric secretions. It acts as a cholecystokinin antagonist, which blocks both the CCKA and CCKB subtypes. It was used mainly in the treatment of stomach ulcers, although it has now been largely replaced by newer drugs for this application. An interesting side effect of proglumide is that it enhances the analgesia produced by opioid drugs, and can prevent or even reverse the development of tolerance to opioid drugs. This can make it a useful adjuvant treatment to use alongside opioid drugs in the treatment of chronic pain conditions such as cancer, where opioid analgesics may be required for long periods and development of tolerance reduces clinical efficacy of these drugs. Proglumide has also been shown to act as a Î´-opioid agonist, which may contribute to its analgesic effects. Proglumide also works as a placebo effect amplifier for pain conditions. When injected visibly to a subject, its analgesic effect is bigger than a similarly administered placebo. When injected secretly, it does not have any effect, whereas standard pain drugs have an effect, even if they are administered without the subject's awareness. The supposed mechanism is an enhancement of the neural pathways of expectation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Terguride	Terguride	443951		21OJT43Q88	37686-84-3		Oral		Terguride is a serotonin antagonist. It is used for the treatment of hyperprolactinemia. Terguride is an oral, potent antagonist of 5-HT2B and 5-HT2A (serotonin) receptors. Serotonin stimulates the proliferation of pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells, and induces fibrosis in the wall of pulmonary arteries. Together, this causes vascular remodeling and narrowing of the pulmonary arteries. These changes result in increased vascular resistance and PAH. Due to the potential anti-proliferative and anti-fibrotic activity of terguride, this potential medicine could offer the hope of achieving reversal of pulmonary artery vascular remodeling and attenuation of disease progression. In May 2008, terguride was granted orphan drug status for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. In May 2010 Pfizer purchased world-wide rights for the drug.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihydroergocryptine	Dihydroergocryptine	114948		67V3FSL2GL	25447-66-9		Oral		Dihydroergocryptine (DHEC, trade names Almirid, Cripar) is a dopamine agonist of the ergoline chemical class that is used as an antiparkinson agent. Dihydroergocryptine has been shown to be particularly effective as monotherapy in the early stages of Parkinson's disease. Initial monotherapy with a dopamine agonist is associated with reduced risk for motor complications in Parkinson patients relative to levodopa. DHEC, like other dopamine agonists, aims to mimic the endogenous neurotransmitter and exert an antiparkinsonian effect. Recent evidence also supports that dopamine receptor agonists, instead of L-DOPA may slow or prevent the progression of Parkinson's disease. Dihydroergocryptine can also be used in migraine prophylaxis, as well as for the treatment of low blood pressure in elderly patients and peripheral vascular disorder. More commonly, it is used in combination with two similar compounds, dihydroergocornine and dihydroergocristine. This mixture is called ergoloid or codergocrine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lofentanil	Lofentanil	10070040		7H7YQ564XV	61380-40-3				Lofentanil is one of the most potent opioid analgesics known and is an analogue of fentanyl, which was developed in 1960. It is most similar to the highly potent opioid carfentanil (4-carbomethoxyfentanyl), only slightly more potent. Lofentanil can be described as 3-methylcarfentanil, or 3-methyl-4-carbomethoxyfentanyl. While 3-methylfentanyl is considerably more potent than fentanyl itself, lofentanil is only slightly stronger than carfentanil. This suggests that substitution at both the 3 and 4 positions of the piperidine ring introduces steric hindrance which prevents Î¼-opioid affinity from increasing much further. As with other 3-substituted fentanyl derivatives such as ohmefentanyl, the stereoisomerism of lofentanil is very important, with some stereoisomers being much more potent than others. Lofentanil is very similar to carfentanil in effects, but has a longer duration of action. This makes it unsuitable for most practical applications, with carfentanil being the preferred agent for tranquilizing large animals, and short-acting derivatives such as sufentanil or remifentanil being preferred for medical use in human surgical procedures. The long duration and high lipophilicity of lofentanil has been suggested as an advantage for certain types of analgesia, but the main application for lofentanil at the present time is research into opioid receptors. Side effects from lofentanil would be predicted to be similar to other potent fentanyl analogues, and would include sedation, euphoria, nausea, and pronounced itching and respiratory depression. Side effects from lofentanil might be particularly problematic given its reportedly long duration of action. Another side effect which is characteristic of fentanyl and its derivatives is their tendency to rapidly induce tolerance, due to their high binding affinity triggering rapid internalization of chronically activated opiate receptors. This might be expected to be a particular problem with lofentanil as it is not only one of the most potent drugs in the series, but also is longer acting than most other fentanyl analogues, meaning that development of tolerance triggered by receptor over-activation is likely to be especially rapid.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lubeluzole	Lubeluzole	65998		V2SIB71583	144665-07-6				Lubeluzole (Prosynap) is a drug which acts as an indirect NMDA antagonist. It inhibits the release of glutamate, inhibits nitric oxide synthesis, and blocks calcium and sodium gated ion channels. It has neuroprotective effects particularly in hypoxic conditions, and was developed for the treatment of stroke. Trials showed it to be safe, effective and well tolerated at low doses, but unfortunately higher doses produced the dangerous cardiac side effect of lengthening the QTc interval, which could potentially lead to heart failure, and so this meant that subsequent trials were limited to using only the low dose range. Animal studies had shown lubeluzole to produce neuroprotective effects when administered for prolonged periods, but the aim of its developers was to produce a drug that would be effective for preventing damage from acute stroke, and so ultimately it failed to show sufficient efficacy in trials and development for medical use was halted.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Menitrazepam	Menitrazepam	189875		1243654WZK	28781-64-8				Menitrazepam is a drug which is a benzodiazepine derivative. It is similar in structure to tetrazepam and nimetazepam, with the 7-chloro group of tetrazepam replaced by nitro. It is a hypnotic agent used in the treatment of insomnia, and therefore has strong sedative, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and anxiolytic actions like those of other hypnotic benzodiazepines. Menitrazepam is a good oral hypnotic agent, however, delay in the time for peak plasma levels to reach their maximum brings into question the benefit of menitrazepam for the treatment of insomnia when compared to other hypnotics. Typically, the sleep inducing properties of hypnotics occur within 0.5 hours. In some cases, as with temazepam and nitrazepam, strong hypnotic effects can be felt 15 to 20 minutes after oral ingestion. 40px This pharmacology-related article is a stub.

It has an active metabolite N-desmethylmetaclazepam, which is the main metabolite of metaclazepam. There is no significant difference in metabolism between younger and older individuals. Metaclazepam is slightly more effective as an anxiolytic than bromazepam, or diazepam, with a 15 mg dose of metaclazepam equivalent to 4 mg of bromazepam. Metaclazepam can interact with alcohol producing additive sedative-hypnotic effects. Fatigue is a common side effect from metaclazepam at high doses. Small amounts of metaclazepam as well as its metabolites enter into human breast milk.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midafotel	Midafotel	6437356		7LYU6ZF84G	137424-80-7				"Midafotel (CPPene; SDZ EAA 494) is a potent, competitive antagonist at the NMDA receptor. It was originally designed as a potential therapy for excitotoxicity, epilepsy or neuropathic pain. It looked very promising in in vitro trials proving to be a potent competitive antagonist at the NMDA without affecting other receptors. Research continued through to in vivo cat studies where it proved to limit damage after occluding the middle cerebral artery, leading to ischaemia. It also blocked photosensitive epilepsies in baboons. CPPene had a pharmacokinetic profile suitable for progressing to clinical trials, as it has no toxic by products, is excreted exclusively via the renal system, and remains unchanged in the brain. However, CPPene was removed from clinical trials, as it provided no suitable neuronal protection or beneficial treatment for epilepsy, and had side effects which led to many patients withdrawing from trials. A possible explanation for its lack of efficacy in trials is the relatively short therapeutic time window following ischaemic damage and the fact that a small amount of glutamate helps neuronal survival. It is also believed that some ""pro-survival"" genes are activated by NMDA receptors."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Muraglitazar	Muraglitazar	206044		W1MKM70WQI	331741-94-7				Muraglitazar (proposed tradename Pargluva) is a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist with affinity to PPARÎ± and PPARÎ³. The drug had completed phase III clinical trials, however in May, 2006 Bristol-Myers Squibb announced that it had discontinued further development. Data on muraglitazar is relatively less due to the recent introduction of this agent. One double-blind randomized clinical trial comparing muraglitazar and pioglitazone found that the effects of the former were favourable in terms of HDL-C increase, decrease in total cholesterol, apolipoprotein B, triglycerides and a greater reduction in HbA1c (P<0.0001 for all comparisons). However, the muraglitazar group had a higher all-cause mortality, greater incidence of edema and heart failure and more weight gain compared to the pioglitazone group. A meta-analysis of the phase 2 and 3 clinical trials of muraglitazar revealed that it was associated with a greater incidence of myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attacks and CHF when compared to placebo or pioglitazone.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Myrophine	Myrophine	635600		417TUP54OL	467-18-5				Myrophine (Myristylbenzylmorphine) is an opiate analogue that was developed in 1952. It is a derivative of morphine. Myrophine is substituted with a 3-benzyl group and a 6-myristyl chain. It is metabolised to form benzylmorphine and then further to morphine, and so is a long-acting prodrug for morphine, but with a slow onset of effects. It is weaker than morphine as an analgesic but longer lasting in effects, and was thought to have more local anesthetic effect than morphine, though with a somewhat greater tendency to cause histamine reactions like itching and rash. In addiction studies conducted in human subjects in the 1950s, myrophine did not substitute for morphine in withdrawal, did not produce notable morphine-like effects, and did not produce addiction or dependence regardless of dose or how it was administered. Consequently it was thought to be useful in treating pain in addicts who were being detoxified from other opioid drugs. It is a Schedule I drug in the USA, considered to have high potential for abuse and no medical applications, and is controlled under international drug conventions. Myrophine is almost invariably used as the hydrochloride (free base conversion ratio 0.94) and has a DEA Administrative Controlled Substance Control Number of 9308. Myrophine is a Class A controlled substance in the UK, and is on the UN's Yellow list.

Oxyfedrine was found to depress the tonicity of coronary vessels, improve myocardial metabolism (so that heart can sustain hypoxia better) and also exert a positive chronotropic and inotrophic effects, thereby not precipitating Angina pectoris. The latter property (positive chronotropic and inotrophic effects) is particularly important, because other vasodilators used in angina may be counter productive causing coronary steal phenomenon. Synergestic effects with antibiotics have been suggested.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Panadiplon	Panadiplon	3033821		V4PW0S7ZP7	124423-84-3				Panadiplon (U-78875) is an anxiolytic drug with a novel chemical structure that is not closely related to other drugs of this type. It has a similar pharmacological profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and relatively little sedative or amnestic effect, and so is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. Panadiplon acts as a high-affinity GABAA receptor partial agonist, but despite showing a useful effects profile of a potent anxiolytic with little sedative effects, panadiplon was discontinued from clinical development for use in humans after showing evidence of liver damage in both animals and human trials. Panadiplon however continues to be used in animal research, mainly as a subtype-selective reference drug to compare other GABAA agonists against.

It was invented in the 1960s by American Cyanamid Co.. Later, a team at Miles Laboratories discovered that adding a 4-phenyl to the piperidine ring produces a compound with activity almost identical to that of fentanyl. Phenampromide produces similar effects to other opioids, including analgesia, sedation, dizziness and nausea.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Picenadol	Picenadol	53077		TV3535QWTJ	79201-85-7				Picenadol (LY-97435) is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is an opioid analgesic drug developed by Eli Lilly in the 1970s. Picenadol is an effective analgesic with similar efficacy to pethidine (meperidine). It has been investigated for some applications such as obstetrics and dentistry, but never commercialised. It is unusual in that one enantiomer is a pure Î¼-opioid agonist, while the other is an antagonist. The (3R,4R) isomer is the agonist, while (3S,4S) is antagonist. This means that the racemic mix of the two enantiomers is a mixed agonist-antagonist, with relatively low abuse potential, and little of the Îº-opioid activity that tends to cause problems with other opioid mixed agonist-antagonists such as pentazocine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piminodine	Piminodine	21950		3IIX447HWS	13495-09-5				Piminodine (Alvodine) is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of pethidine (meperidine). It was used in medicine briefly during the 1960s and 70s, but has largely fallen out of clinical use. It was used particularly for obstetric analgesia and in dental procedures and, like pethidine, could be combined with hydroxyzine to intensify the effects. The duration of action is 2 to 4 hours and 7.5 to 10 mg via the subcutaneous route is the most common starting dose, being equal to 80 to 100 mg of pethidine, 40 to 60 mg of alphaprodine and 10 mg of morphine. Oral formulations were also available. Piminodine has similar effects to other opioids, and produces analgesia, sedation and euphoria.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Solabegron	Solabegron	6433123		55P6YH9O6N	451470-34-1				Solabegron (GW-427,353) is a drug which acts as a selective agonist for the Î²3 adrenergic receptor. It is being developed for the treatment of overactive bladder and irritable bowel syndrome. It has been shown to produce visceral analgesia by releasing somatostatin from adipocytes. , Solabegron was discovered by GlaxoSmithKline and acquired by AltheRx in March 2011. Solabegron relaxes the bladder smooth muscle by stimulating beta-3 adrenoceptors, a novel mechanism compared to older established drug treatments for overactive bladder syndrome such as the anticholinergic agents. Astellas Pharma have developed the first commercially available Î²3 adrenergic receptor, mirabegron, which is now licensed in Japan and the US for overactive bladder. Mirabegron is not licensed for irritable bowel syndrome. A Phase II study of Solabegron for overactive bladder (OAB) looked at 258 patients with moderate to severe incontinence experiencing an average of 4.5 wet episodes per day. Results demonstrated a statistically significant improvement with Solabegron as compared to placebo, as measured by the percent reduction of the number of wet episodes and the absolute number of daily voids. A Phase II study for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) evaluated 102 patients with IBS. Solabegron demonstrated significant reduction in pain associated with the disorder and a trend for greater improvement in the quality of life, compared to placebo. Both Phase II studies indicated a tolerability profile for Solabegron that was similar to placebo. The OAB patients did not suffer from dry mouth, constipation, increase in heart rate or cognitive issues. AltheRx is currently preparing to advance Solabegron into a large clinical study in OAB.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tedisamil	Tedisamil	65825		A5VAY2U3R8	90961-53-8				Tedisamil (3,7-dicyclopropylmethyl-9,9-tetramethylene-3,7-diazabicyclo-3,3,1-nonane) is an experimental class III antiarrhythmic agent currently being investigated for the treatment of atrial fibrillation. Tedisamil blocks multiple types of potassium channels in the heart resulting in slowed heart rate. While the effects of tedisamil have been demonstrated in both atrial and ventricular muscle, repolarization is prolonged more efficiently in the atria. Tedisamil is administered intravenously and has a half-life of approximately 8 â€“13 hours in circulation. Tedisamil is being developed as an alternative to other antiarrhythmics as incidence of additional arrhythmic events is lower compared to other class III agents. Tedisamil also has significant anti-ischemic properties and was initially investigated as a potential treatment for angina until its antiarrhythmic effects were discovered. Tedisamil is manufactured by Solvay Pharmaceuticals Inc. under the proposed trade name Pulzium and is currently in phase III of clinical testing for atrial fibrillation.

It has neurotrophic and neuroprotective effects in vitro, and has been proposed for use in the treatment of several neurodegenerative conditions including amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Alzheimer's disease. Development of xaliproden for these two indications was discontinued in 2007 following analysis of Phase III data. While the drug did show an effect on hippocampal volume (suggesting perhaps a slowing of cell loss), there was insufficient evidence for efficacy in counteracting Alzheimer's related cognitive decline. Similarly while there were some indicators of efficacy in ALS, including a small but clinically noteworthy effect on some functional parameters, the overall benefit did not reach statistical significance when results across several Phase III trials were averaged. Xaliproden remains under investigation for treatment of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levonantradol	Levonantradol	5361881		03S640ADSK	71048-87-8				Levonantradol (CP 50,556-1) is a synthetic cannabinoid analog of dronabinol (Marinol) developed by Pfizer in the 1980s. It is around 30x more potent than THC, and exhibits antiemetic and analgesic effects via activation of CB1 and CB2 cannabinoid receptors. Levonantradol is not currently used in medicine as dronabinol or nabilone are felt to be more useful for most conditions, however it is widely used in research into the potential therapeutic applications of cannabinoids. Pharmacodynamics: Levonantradol is a full CB1 receptor agonist. Cannabinoid receptors belong to the superfamily of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs), and endogenous cannabinoids naturally activate GPCRs. GPCRs modulate the inhibition of adenylyl cyclase and accumulation of the second messenger, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). The CB1 receptor is the most common GPCR in the central nervous system. The activation of CB1Rs decrease calcium conductance and increase potassium conductance in the brain. CB signaling naturally modulates synaptic transmission and mediates psychoactivity, and synthetic cannabinoids mimic these same actions. Although the efficacy of Levonantradol is dependent on the level of GCPR activity, Full agonists like Levonantradol have the ability to activate GPCRs and convert GÎ± into a high affinity state for GTP or low affinity state for GDP. Previous studies suggest that Levonantradol has a higher binding affinity and efficacy than other similar synthetic cannabinoids (e.g. Î”-THC). Pharmacokinetics: Although Levonantradol has been extensively tested on animals including cats, rodents, and non-human primates. It has also been tested among cancer patient populations in clinical trials. Levonantradol is most commonly administered intramuscularly (I.M. ), however it can also be administered orally. The dosage can range from 0.25 mg-3.0 mg every 2-4 hours, and the half-life is 1-2 hours. In order to administer Levonantradol intramuscularly, the drug must be dissolved in 5% ethanol, 5% emulphur, and 90% sterile saline. Synthetic cannabinoids like Levonantradol readily cross the blood-brain barrier because they are highly lipophilic and have low molecular weights. Levonantradolâ€™s bioavailability is variable due to the first pass metabolism. Treatment: Levonantradol has been clinically tested in cancer patients for its pain relief and antiemetic benefits. Cancer patients that endure chemotherapy often develop intense nausea, and Levonantradol has been tested to reduce these emetic symptoms. It is often used instead of THC because it has a higher efficacy. Levonantradol also acts on pain pathways in the central nervous system, which enables the drug to alleviate pain. Studies have shown an absence of emetic side effects within the half-life of the Levonantradol administered. Other studies suggest that cannabinoid agonists can synergize opioid anti-nociception. Cannabinoid receptors are located in nociceptive pathways, and CBs can promote signal transduction in TRP channels. Although Levonantradol relieves nociceptive and postoperative pain, decreases nausea, and improves spasticity in addition to being more effective than placebos, it has yet to be approved as legal medicine. Researchers have concluded that Levonantradol is no more effective than Codeine, which is why they do not recommend expansion into clinical practice. Side Effects: The side effects for Levonantradol include ptosis, sedation, and ataxia in non-human primates. In rodents, the symptoms include dysphoria, memory impairment, motor incoordination, reduced concentration, and disorientation. Levonantradol also decreases startle response. In humans, side effects include dry mouth, drowsiness, dizziness, altered perception, mild sedation, and lack of concentration. It can cause an increase in heart rate and decrease in blood pressure. Euphoric symptoms rarely occurred in subjects.

The development for PD and ALS have been terminated due to lack of benefit, but Santhera Pharmaceuticals bought the compound for development for the treatment of congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD). Omigapil was first synthesized at Ciba-Geigy, Basel, Switzerland. Santhera Pharmaceuticals has since taken over production of omigapil and preclinical trials for CMD. In May 2008, omigapil was granted orphan designation to commence clinical trials for. Pharmacokinetic trials are scheduled to commence enrollment in the second half of 2012 to determine the appropriate pharmacokinetic profile of the drug for children with laminin-Î±2-deficient congenital muscular dystrophy (MDC1A) and collagen VI related myopathy. Santhera Pharmaceuticals will use the phase 1 clinical trial to determine if the drug is safe and acts with the same pharmacokinetic profile in children as it does in adults. The impending clinical trial will take place in the United States at the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke/National Institute of Health(NNDCS/NINDS) (Bethesda, Maryland) and in the United Kingdom at Great Ormond Street Hospital (UCL).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sanguinarine	Sanguinarine	5154		AV9VK043SS	2447-54-3				Sanguinarine is a quaternary ammonium salt from the group of benzylisoquinoline alkaloids. It is extracted from some plants, including bloodroot (Sanguinaria canadensis), Mexican prickly poppy Argemone mexicana, Chelidonium majus and Macleaya cordata. It is also found in the root, stem and leaves of the opium poppy but not in the capsule. Sanguinarine is a toxin that kills animal cells through its action on the Na-K-ATPase transmembrane protein. Epidemic dropsy is a disease that results from ingesting sanguinarine. If applied to the skin, sanguinarine kills cells and may destroy tissue. In turn, the bleeding wound may produce a massive scab, called an eschar. For this reason, sanguinarine is termed an escharotic. Numerous published, pre-clinical In Vitro and In Vivo studies have demonstrated that Sanguinarine causes targeted apoptosis in human cancer cells, and recommend future development of Sanguinarine as a potential cancer treatment. A study conducted by the Case Western Reserve University in 2000 found that low doses of sanguinarine caused this apoptosis in cancerous human epidermoid carcinoma cells while little reaction from normal human skin cells was observed. In plants, sanguinarine is synthesized from dihydrosanguinarine through the action of Dihydrobenzophenanthridine oxidase (EC 1.5.3.12).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sisomicin	Sisomicin	36119		X55XSL74YQ			topical		Sisomicin (bactoCeaze or Ensamycin) is an aminoglycoside antibiotic, isolated from the fermentation broth of a new species of the genus Micromonospora. It is a newer broad-spectrum aminoglycoside most structurally related to gentamicin. Sisomicin is the most predictably active aminoglycoside against gram-positive bacteria. Like most other aminoglycosides, Sisomicin is bactericidal for sensitive clinical isolates. The Minimum Bactericidal Concentrations (MBC) have been found to be equivalent or very close to the Minimum Inhibitory Concentrations (MIC). Like other aminoglycosides, most clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa remain susceptible to sisomicin. Resistance to sisomicin may enzymatically or non-enzymatically be mediated. Sisomicin is inactivated by the same enzymes as gentamicin but it is active against many, not all, organisms that resist gentamicin by non-enzymatic mechanisms. Some studies show that sisomicin has been effective in the treatment of infections that either had failed to respond to other drugs or were due to microorganisms resistant in vitro to other aminoglycosides.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trichostatin_A	Trichostatin A	444732	DB04297		58880-19-6				"Trichostatin A (TSA) is an organic compound that serves as an antifungal antibiotic and selectively inhibits the class I and II mammalian histone deacetylase (HDAC) families of enzymes, but not class III HDACs. TSA inhibits the eukaryotic cell cycle during the beginning of the growth stage. TSA can be used to alter gene expression by interfering with the removal of acetyl groups from histones and therefore altering the ability of DNA transcription factors to access the DNA molecules inside chromatin. It is a member of a larger class of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDIs or HDACIs) that have a broad spectrum of epigenetic activities. Thus, TSA has some potential as an anti-cancer drug. One suggested mechanism is that TSA promotes the expression of apoptosis-related genes, leading to cancerous cells surviving at lower rates, thus slowing the progression of cancer. Other mechanisms may include the activity of HDIs to induce cell differentiation, thus acting to ""mature"" some of the de-differentiated cells found in tumors. HDIs have multiple effects on non-histone effector molecules, so the anti-cancer mechanisms are truly not understood at this time. TSA inhibits HDACs 1, 3, 4, 6 and 10 with IC50 values around 20 nM. TSA represses IL (interleukin)-1Î²/LPS/IFNÎ³-induced nitric oxide synthase (NOS)2 expression in murine macrophage-like cells but increases LPS-stimulated NOS2 expression in murine N9 and primary rat microglial cells. However, there are few if any clinical trials of TSA."

It was withdrawn from market in June 2010 when a clinical trial showed the drug increased patient death and added no benefit over conventional cancer therapies. Gemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody to CD33 linked to a cytotoxic agent from the class of calicheamicins. CD33 is expressed in most leukemic blast cells but also in normal hematopoietic cells, the intensity diminishing with maturation of stem cells. In the United States, it was approved under an accelerated-approval process by the FDA in 2000 for use in patients over the age of 60 with relapsed acute myelogenous leukemia (AML); or those who are not considered candidates for standard chemotherapy. Within the first year after approval, the FDA required a black box warning be added to Gemtuzumab packaging. The drug was noted to increase the risk of veno-occlusive disease in the absence of bone marrow transplantation. Later the onset of VOD was shown to occur at increased frequency in Gemtuzumab patients even following bone marrow transplantation. The drug was discussed in a 2008 JAMA article, which criticized the inadequacy of postmarketing surveillance of biologic agents. Common side effects of administration included shivering, fever, nausea and vomiting. Serious side effects included severe myelosuppression (suppressed activity of bone marrow, which is involved in formation of various blood cells), disorder of the respiratory system, tumor lysis syndrome, Type III hypersensitivity, venous occlusion, and death.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Heterocodeine	Heterocodeine	5462505			639-47-4				"Heterocodeine (6-methoxymorphine) is an opiate derivative, the 6-methyl ether of morphine, and a structural isomer of codeine; it is called ""hetero-"" because it is the reverse isomer of codeine. Heterocodeine was first synthesised in 1932 and first patented in 1935. It can be made from morphine by selective methylation. Codeine is the natural mono-methyl ether, but must be metabolized for activity (that is, it is a prodrug). In contrast the semi-synthetic mono-methyl ether, heterocodeine is a direct agonist. Heterocodeine is 6 times more potent than morphine due to having a substitution at the 6-hydroxy position, in a similar manner to 6-acetylmorphine. The drug methyldihydromorphine (dihydroheterocodeine) is a derivative of heterocodeine. Like the morphine metabolite morphine-6-glucuronide, 6-position branches (esters or ethers) of morphine bind to the otherwise unagonized human mu receptor subtype mu-3 (or Î¼3); as well as the 6-acetylmorphine metabolite of heroin this includes heterocodeine."

Himbacine has been synthesized using a Diels-Alder reaction as a key step. Himbacine's activity as a muscarinic receptor antagonist, with specificity for the Muscarinic acetylcholine receptor M2, made it a promising starting point in Alzheimer's disease research. The development of a muscarinic antagonist based on Himbacine failed but an analog is now in clinical trials as a thrombin receptor antagonist.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Imidazenil	Imidazenil	119194			151271-08-8				Imidazenil is an anxiolytic drug which is derived from the benzodiazepine family, and is most closely related to other imidazobenzodiazepines such as midazolam, flumazenil and bretazenil. Imidazenil is a GABAA partial agonist with an unusual profile of effects, producing some of the effects associated with normal benzodiazepines such as anticonvulsant and anxiolytic effects, yet without any notable sedative or amnestic effects. In fact, imidazenil blocks the sedative effects of diazepam, yet without lowering the convulsion threshold, and so potentially could be a more flexible antidote than the antagonist flumazenil which is commonly used to treat benzodiazepine overdose at present. This unusual profile of effects makes imidazenil potentially a very useful drug. In animal studies it has been shown to be an effective anxiolytic and strong anticonvulsant, yet without many of the side effects associated with other benzodiazepines; it does not produce tolerance or dependence, reverses the amnestic effects of conventional benzodiazepines, and does not potentiate the effects of alcohol. Imidazenil has not yet been developed commercially for use in humans, however it has been suggested as a safe and effective treatment for anxiety, a potent yet non-sedating anticonvulsant which might be particularly useful in the treatment of poisoning with organophosphate nerve agents, and as a novel treatment for schizophrenia.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/L-838,417	L-838,417	9908880			286456-42-6				L-838,417 is an anxiolytic drug used in scientific research. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. The compound was developed by Merck, Sharp and Dohme. L-838,417 is a subtype-selective GABAA agonist, acting as a partial agonist at Î±2, Î±3 and Î±5 subtypes, but as an antagonist at the Î±1 subtype, and has little affinity for the Î±4 or Î±6 subtypes. This gives it selective anxiolytic effects, which are mediated mainly by Î±2 and Î±3 subtypes, but with little sedative or amnestic effects as these effects are mediated by Î±1. Some sedation might still be expected due to its activity at the Î±5 subtype, which can also cause sedation, however no sedative effects were seen in animal studies even at high doses, suggesting that L-838,417 is primarily acting at Î±2 and Î±3 subtypes with the Î±5 subtype of lesser importance. As might be predicted from its binding profile, L-838,417 substitutes for the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide in animals, but not for the hypnotic imidazopyridine drug zolpidem. The synthesis of L-838,417 and similar compounds was described in 2005 in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry.

It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. SB-205,384 is a subtype selective GABAA partial agonist, which binds preferentially to the Î±3 subtype. It has a novel mechanism of action, prolonging the duration of GABA-mediated chloride flux but without increasing the intensity of the response, and this may give it an unusual pharmacological profile, with tests showing that it alters the firing of some populations of neurons while leaving others unaffected. Animal studies have shown it to produce both anxiolytic and anti-aggressive effects, but with little sedation or other behavioural changes.

It was discovered by, and named after, John W. Huffman. JWH-133, alongside WIN 55,212-2 and HU-210, is implicated in preventing the inflammation caused by Amyloid beta proteins involved in Alzheimer's Disease, in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This antiinflamatory action is induced through agonist action at cannabinoid receptors, which prevents microglial activation that elicits the inflammation. Additionally, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglia activation in rat models. It may be linked with anti-cancer properties, according to pre-trial data from a 2010 study in Madrid.

WIN 55,212-2 is a potent cannabinoid receptor agonist that has been found to be a potent analgesic in a rat model of neuropathic pain. It activates p42 and p44 MAP kinase via receptor-mediated signaling. At 5 ÂµM WIN 55,212-2 inhibit ATP production in sperm in a CB1 receptor-dependent fashion. WIN 55,212-2, along with HU-210 and JWH-133, may prevent the inflammation caused by amyloid beta proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This anti-inflammatory action is induced through agonist action at cannabinoid receptors, which prevents microglial activation that elicits the inflammation. Additionally, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglial activation in rat models. WIN 55,212-2 is a full agonist at the CB1 cannabinoid receptor (Ki = 1.9 nM) and has much higher affinity than THC (Ki = 41 nM) for this receptor. WIN 55,212-2 reduces voluntary wheel running in laboratory mice, but with effects that depend on both genetic background and sex.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gabazine	Gabazine	107895			104104-50-9				Gabazine (SR-95531) is a drug that acts as an antagonist at GABAA receptors. It is used in scientific research and has no role in medicine, as it would be expected to produce convulsions if used in humans. Gabazine binds to the GABA recognition site of the receptor-channel complex and acts as an allosteric inhibitor of channel opening. The net effect is to reduce GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition by inhibiting chloride flux across the cell membrane, and thus inhibiting neuronal hyperpolarization. While phasic (synaptic) inhibition is gabazine-sensitive, tonic (extrasynaptic) inhibition is relatively gabazine-insensitive.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Difluoropine	Difluoropine	190851			156774-35-5				Difluoropine (O-620) is a stimulant drug synthesised from tropinone, which acts as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor. Difluoropine is unique among the tropane-derived dopamine reuptake inhibitors in that the active stereoisomer is the (S) enantiomer rather than the (R) enantiomer, the opposite way round compared to natural cocaine. It is structurally related to benztropine and has similar anticholinergic and antihistamine effects in addition to its dopamine reuptake inhibitory action. Difluoropine has some stimulant effects in animals, although it is significantly less powerful than many of the potent phenyltropane derived stimulant drugs such as WIN 35,428 and RTI-55. It showed promising effects in alleviating the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease in an animal model of the disorder. It is not explicitly illegal anywhere in the world as of 2008, but might be considered to be a controlled substance analogue of cocaine on the grounds of its related chemical structure, in some jurisdictions such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Androstene-3,6,17-trione	4-Androstene-3,6,17-trione				2243-06-3		oral		"4-Androstene-3,6,17-trione (4-AT; also marketed as 6-OXO or 4-etioallocholen-3,6,17-trione) is a drug or nutritional supplement that may increase the testosterone-estrogen ratio, but has no proven effect on body composition. Its use can be detected in urine. 4-AT is a potent irreversible aromatase inhibitor that inhibits estrogen biosynthesis by permanently binding and inactivating aromatase in adipose and peripheral tissue. Aromatase is responsible for the conversion of testosterone to estradiol. Blocking aromatase causes the body to decrease in levels of estradiol, which then results in increase of LH and consequently, testosterone. Since testosterone has myotropic activity and estradiol does not, elevated testosterone levels increase muscle mass. However, there appear to be no human or animal studies testing the hypothesis that 4-AT will produce an anabolic effect. 4-AT is also used by steroid or prohormone users to counteract estrogen level increases caused by aromatization during their steroid cycle. This helps minimize side effects such as gynecomastia but can lead to acne. Also, after a steroid cycle, the compound may be used to shorten the recovery from the testicular suppression that can be the result of the use of steroids. Baylor University conducted an eight-week study to determine the effects of 300Â mg or 600Â mg of 4-AT in resistance-trained males. Compared to baseline, free testosterone increased by 90% for 300Â mg group and 84% for 600Â mg group, respectively. Also dihydrotestosterone and the ratio of free testosterone to estradiol increased significantly. The report concluded that ""[t t]he results of this study indicate that eight weeks of 6-OXO supplementation had no effect on body composition or clinical safety markers, but incompletely inhibited aromatase activity and significantly increased endogenous DHT levels that were attenuated after a three-week washout period"". This study did not utilize a control group and was funded in part by two producers of commercial 4-AT. In a FDA Warning Letter dated July 7, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) argues that marketing of 4-AT violates the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act and as such products containing it are adulterated by legal definition. In 2008, Health Canada issued a warning that 4-AT had a health risk related to blood clotting and recommended all users immediately cease use."

It is a member of the biarylpropylsulfonamide class of ampakines. LY-404,187 has been demonstrated to enhance cognitive function in animal studies, and has also shown effects suggesting antidepressant action as well as having possible application in the treatment of schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and ADHD. These effects appear to be mediated through multiple mechanisms of action secondary to AMPA receptor potentiation, with a prominent effect seen in research being increased levels of BDNF in the brain. It may therefore be continued on to human trials, although Eli Lilly has developed a whole family of biarylpropylsulfonamide derivatives and it is unclear at this stage which compound is most likely to be selected for further development."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/SL-651,498	SL-651,498				205881-86-3				SL-651,498 is an anxiolytic and anticonvulsant drug used in scientific research, with a chemical structure most closely related to Î²-carboline derivatives such as abecarnil and gedocarnil. It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. SL-651,498 is a subtype-selective GABAA agonist, which acts as a full agonist at Î±2 and Î±3 subtypes, and as a partial agonist at Î±1 and Î±5 (although its action at Î±5 subtypes is much weaker than at the others). In animal studies, it has primarily anxiolytic effects, although some sedation, ataxia and muscle relaxant effects are observed at higher doses. It substitutes fully for the anxiolytic benzodiazepine chlordiazepoxide, but only partially substituted for the imidazopyridine hypnotic drug zolpidem and the benzodiazepine hypnotic triazolam. When given repeatedly it failed to produce tolerance or dependence, probably due to its low affinity and efficacy at the Î±5 subtype. SL-651,498 has been suggested for development as a novel non-sedating anxiolytic drug for humans, although it is still only at an early stage of research. Preliminary human trials suggest similar efficacy to lorazepam as an anxiolytic, but with little or no sedation or impairment of memory, motor skills or cognitive function. There are other possibly anxioselective compounds in development, such as L-838,417, NGD 91-3.

It is the Î²-keto analogue of MBDB. Butylone was first synthesized by Koeppe, Ludwig and Zeile which is mentioned in their 1967 paper. It remained an obscure product of academia until 2005 when it was synthesized by a chemical supply company, and has since continued to be sold as a research chemical. It has since been explored as a possible entheogen. Butylone shares the same relationship to MBDB as methylone does to MDMA (""Ecstasy""). The dosage range is not fully understood but seems to be lower than for MBDB. Formal research on this chemical was first conducted in 2009, when it was shown to be metabolised in a similar manner to related drugs like methylone."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Microbicides_for_sexually_transmitted_diseases	Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases				147127-20-6				Microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases are pharmacologic agents and chemical substances that are capable of killing or destroying certain microorganisms that commonly cause human infection (for example, the human immunodeficiency virus). Microbicides are a diverse group of chemical compounds that exert their activity by a variety of different mechanisms of action. Multiple compounds are being developed and tested for their microbicidal activity in clinical trials. Microbicides can be formulated in various delivery systems including gels, creams, lotions, aerosol sprays, tablets or films (which must be used near the time of sexual intercourse) and sponges and vaginal rings (or other devices that release the active ingredient over a longer period). Some of these agents are being developed for vaginal application, and for rectal use by those engaging in anal sex. Although there are many approaches to preventing sexually transmitted diseases in general (and HIV in particular), current methods have not been sufficient to halt the spread of these diseases (particularly among women and people in less-developed nations). Sexual abstinence is not a realistic option for women who want to bear children, or who are at risk of sexual violence. In such situations, the use of microbicides could offer both primary protection (in the absence of condoms) and secondary protection (if a condom breaks or slips off during intercourse). It is hoped that microbicides may be safe and effective in reducing the risk of HIV transmission during sexual activity with an infected partner.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hepatitis_A_vaccine	Hepatitis A vaccine	85154227					IM		Hepatitis A vaccine is a vaccine against the hepatitis A virus. The first successful vaccine against it was invented by Maurice Hilleman at Merck. The vaccine protects against the virus in more than 95% of cases and provides protection from the virus for at least fifteen years. There are two types of vaccines: one type contains inactivated Hepatitis A virus, the other contains a live but attenuated virus. Both types stimulate active immunity against a future infection. Within the USA the vaccine was first phased in around 1996 for children living in high-risk areas. In 1999, it was spread to areas with elevating levels of infection. Today, in the U.S. , the vaccine is strongly recommended for all children 12 to 23 months of age in an attempt to eradicate the virus nationwide. The original FDA license for Havrix by GlaxoSmithKline is dated in 1995, it has been in use in Europe since 1993. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the following people should be vaccinated: all children over one year of age, people whose sexual activity puts them at risk, people with chronic liver disease, people who are being treated with clotting factor concentrates, people working within close proximity to the virus, and people who are living in communities where an outbreak is present. Hepatitis A is the most common vaccine-preventable virus acquired during travel, so people travelling to places where the virus is common like the Indian Subcontinent, Africa, Central America, South America, the far East, and Eastern Europe should also be vaccinated. The vaccine should be given in the muscle of the upper arm and be given in two doses for the best protection. The initial dose of the vaccine should be followed up by a booster six to twelve months later. Protection against Hepatitis A begins approximately two to four weeks after the initial vaccination. Protection is proven to last at least 15 years and is estimated to last at least 25 years if the full course is administered. A Cochrane review found that both types of vaccines offer significant protection, for at least two years with the inactivated vaccine and at least five years with the attenuated vaccine. The review also found evidence to conclude that the inactivated vaccine was safe, but required more high quality evidence to assess the safety of the attenuated vaccine.

It consists of 300 milligrams of tenofovir and 200 milligrams of emtricitabine. The drug has been examined for use as a pre-exposure prophylaxis against HIV infection. A Cochrane review found that both tenofovir alone, as well as the tenofovir/emtricitabine combination, significantly decreased the risk of contracting HIV. The Food and Drug Administration approved it for prophylactic use on July 16, 2012. It is estimated that daily intake of Truvada achieves a 99% of risk reduction of contracting HIV in high risk individuals. In certain studies, the drug has demonstrated rare side effects including: transient nausea, dizziness, loss of appetite and loose stools.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/EDMA	EDMA	24257269					http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		3,4-Ethylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (EDMA) is an entactogen drug of the amphetamine class. It is an analogue of MDMA where the methylenedioxy ring has been replaced by an ethylenedioxy ring. EDMA was first synthesized by Alexander Shulgin. In his book PiHKAL, the dosage is listed as 150â€“250Â mg, and the duration listed as 3â€“5 hours. According to Shulgin, EDMA produces a bare threshold consisting of paresthesia, nystagmus, and hypnogogic imagery, with few to no other effects. Scientific research has demonstrated that EDMA acts as a non-neurotoxic serotonin releasing agent with moderately diminished potency relative to MDMA, and with negligible effects on dopamine release. Based on Shulgin's reports of essential inactivity at 150â€“250Â mg, it may be more active at higher doses.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Herkinorin	Herkinorin	11431898							Herkinorin is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of the natural product Salvinorin A. It was discovered in 2005 during structure-activity relationship studies into neoclerodane diterpenes, the family of chemical compounds of which Salvinorin A is a member. Unlike Salvinorin A which is a selective Îº-opioid agonist with no significant Î¼-opioid receptor affinity, herkinorin is a Î¼-opioid agonist with more than 100x higher Î¼-opioid affinity and 50x lower Îº-opioid affinity compared to Salvinorin A. Herkinorin is a semi-synthetic compound, made from Salvinorin B, which is most conveniently made from Salvinorin A by deacetylation, as while both Salvinorin A and Salvinorin B are found in the plant Salvia divinorum, Salvinorin A is present in larger quantities. A study in primates showed it to act as both a peripherally active Î¼ and Îº agonist with a fast onset of action. The study did not find any evidence of central activity in primates and questions whether herkinorin's effects are due entirely to peripheral binding. Unlike most Î¼-opioid agonists, herkinorin does not promote the recruitment of Î²-arrestin-2 to the intracellular domain of the Î¼-opioid receptor, or induce receptor internalization. This means that herkinorin may not produce tolerance and dependence in the same way as other opioids, although some development of tolerance through other mechanisms has been observed, and some other analogues related to herkinorin can recruit Î²-arrestins.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/L-655,708	L-655,708	5311203							L-655,708 (FG-8094) is a nootropic drug invented in 1996 by a team working for Merck, Sharp and Dohme, that was the first compound developed which acts as a subtype-selective inverse agonist at the Î±5 subtype of the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor. It acts as an inverse agonist at the Î±1, Î±2, Î±3 and Î±5 subtypes, but with much higher affinity for Î±5, and unlike newer Î±5 inverse agonists such as Î±5IA, L-655,708 exerts its subtype selectivity purely via higher binding affinity for this receptor subtype, with its efficacy as an inverse agonist being around the same at all the subtypes it binds to. A radiolabelled form of L-655,708 was used to map the distribution of the GABAA Î±5 subtype in the brain, and it was found to be expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with learning and memory. Activation of this subtype is thought to be largely responsible for producing the cognitive side effects displayed by many benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as amnesia and difficulties with learning and memory, and so this led researchers to conclude that a drug acting as an inverse agonist at this subtype should have the opposite effect and enhance learning and memory. L-655,708 was indeed found to produce improved cognitive performance in animal studies, without producing the side effect of convulsions which is produced by non-selective inverse agonists like DMCM. However it was found to be anxiogenic at doses which enhanced cognition, most likely because of its inverse agonist effects on other subtypes such as Î±2 and Î±3, making it unlikely that this drug would be suitable for use as a nootropic in humans. Still, L-655,708 may find use in the clinic to combat postoperative cognitive dysfunction since administration of sub-nootropic doses of L-655,708 prevented persistent memory impairment in mice anesthetized with isoflurane.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/NESS-0327	NESS-0327	10435654							NESS-0327 is a drug used in scientific research which acts as an extremely potent and selective antagonist of the cannabinoid receptor CB1. It is much more potent an antagonist, and more selective for the CB1 receptor over CB2, than the more commonly used ligand rimonabant, with a Ki at CB1 of 350fM (i.e. 0.00035nM) and a selectivity of over 60,000x for CB1 over CB2. Independently, two other groups have described only modest nanomolar CB1 affinity for this compound (125nM and 18.4nM). Also unlike rimonabant, NESS-0327 does not appear to act as an inverse agonist at higher doses, instead being a purely neutral antagonist which blocks the CB1 receptor but does not produce any physiological effect of its own.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ro48-6791	Ro48-6791	9953485							Ro48-6791 is a drug, a benzodiazepine derivative developed by Hoffman-LaRoche in the 1990s. Ro48-6791 was developed as an alternative to the short-acting imidazobenzodiazepine midazolam, for use in induction of anaesthesia and conscious sedation for minor invasive procedures. Ro48-6791 has properties similar to those of to midazolam, being water soluble, with a fast onset and short duration of action. It is 4-6x more potent than midazolam, and slightly shorter acting, and produces similar side effects such as sedation and amnesia. It was tested up to Phase II human trials, but while it produced less respiratory depression than propofol, it had a longer recovery time and was deemed not to have any significant advantages over the older drug. Similarly when Ro48-6791 was compared to midazolam, it had similar efficacy, higher potency and a shorter recovery time, but produced less of a synergistic effect on opioid-induced analgesia and produced more severe side effects such as dizziness after the procedure. Consequently it was dropped from clinical development, although it is still used in scientific research.

It is reddish-brown in color and tastes extremely bitter. Laudanum contains almost all of the opium alkaloids, including morphine and codeine. A potent narcotic by virtue of its high morphine concentration, laudanum was historically used to treat a variety of ailments, but its principal use was as an analgesic and cough suppressant. Until the early 20th century, laudanum was sold without a prescription and was a constituent of many patent medicines. Today, laudanum is recognized as addictive and is strictly regulated and controlled throughout most of the world. Laudanum is known as a ""whole opium"" preparation since it historically contained all the opium alkaloids.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/MMR_vaccine	MMR vaccine								The MMR vaccine is an immunization shot against measles, mumps, and rubella (also called German measles). It was first developed by Maurice Hilleman while at Merck in the late 1960s. The vaccine is a mixture of three live attenuated viruses, administered via injection. The shot is generally administered to children around the age of one year, with a second dose before starting school (i.e. age 4/5). The second dose is a dose to produce immunity in the small number of persons (2â€“5%) who fail to develop measles immunity after the first dose. In the United States, the vaccine was licensed in 1971 and the second dose was introduced in 1989. It is widely used around the world; since introduction of its earliest versions in the 1970s, over 500 million doses have been used in over 60 countries. As with all vaccinations, long-term effects and efficacy are subject to continuing study. The vaccine is sold by Merck as M-M-R II, GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals as Priorix, Serum Institute of India as Tresivac, and Sanofi Pasteur as Trimovax. It is usually considered a childhood vaccination. However, it is also recommended for use in some cases of adults with HIV.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lipiodol	Lipiodol								Lipiodol (labeled Ethiodol in the USA), also known as ethiodized oil, is a poppyseed oil used by injection as a radio-opaque contrast agent that is used to outline structures in radiological investigations. It is used in chemoembolization applications as a contrast agent in follow-up imaging. Lipiodol is also used in lymphangiography, the imaging of the lymphatic system. It has an additional use in gastric variceal obliteration as a dilutant that does not affect polymerization of cyanoacrylate. Recently there has been an increasing interest in the use of Lipiodol as a therapeutic agent in the management of unexplained infertility, using a procedure called Lipiodol flushing. There have been a small number of studies that suggest that flushing the media through the tubes gives a short-term rise in fecundity in patients with unexplained infertility. A systematic review has suggested a significant increase in fertility, especially in those women who have endometriosis when using Lipiodol flushing. Historically Lipiodol was often used as a contrast medium at hysterosalpingography . It became less commonly utilised in the 1960s to 1980s because the more modern water-soluble media give images that are easier to interpret. There is also an important safety issue with Lipiodol in that intravasation (leakage) of the fluid into the venous system has caused complications in the past. Ethiodized oil is composed of iodine combined with ethyl esters of fatty acids of poppyseed oil, primarily as ethyl monoiodostearate and ethyl diiodostearate. The precise structure is not known. Lipiodol was first synthesized by Marcel Guerbet in the Paris School of Pharmacy in 1901. Historically, Lipiodol was the first iodinated contrast agent (used for myelography by two French physicians, Jacques Forestier and Jean Sicard in 1921). Lipiodol is now solely produced and marketed by Guerbet since Savage Laboratories discontinued manufacturing in 2010.

Temozolomide (brand names Temodar and Temodal and Temcad) is an oral alkylating agent used for the treatment of Grade IV astrocytoma â€” an aggressive brain tumor, also known as glioblastoma multiforme â€” as well as for treating melanoma, a form of skin cancer. Temozolomide is also indicated for relapsed Grade III anaplastic astrocytoma and not indicated for, but as of 2011 used to treat oligodendroglioma brain tumors in some countries, replacing the older (and less well tolerated) PCV regimen. The agent was developed by Malcolm Stevens and his team at Aston University in Birmingham, A derivative of imidazotetrazine, temozolomide is the prodrug of MTIC (3-methyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide). It has been available in the US since August 1999, and in other countries since the early 2000s. The therapeutic benefit of temozolomide depends on its ability to alkylate/methylate DNA, which most often occurs at the N-7 or O-6 positions of guanine residues. This methylation damages the DNA and triggers the death of tumor cells. However, some tumor cells are able to repair this type of DNA damage, and therefore diminish the therapeutic efficacy of temozolomide, by expressing a protein called O-6-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) or O-6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase (AGT or AGAT). In some tumors, epigenetic silencing of the MGMT/AGT gene prevents the synthesis of this enzyme, and as a consequence such tumors are more sensitive to killing by temozolomide. Conversely, the presence of MGMT protein in brain tumors predicts poor response to temozolomide and these patients receive little benefit from chemotherapy with temozolomide.

As a supplement or drug, it is used most commonly in the form of a salt, such as sodium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (Na. GHB, sodium oxybate, or Xyrem) or potassium gamma-hydroxybutyrate (K. GHB, potassium oxybate). GHB is also produced as a result of fermentation, and so is found in small quantities in some beers and wines. Succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase deficiency is a disease that causes GHB to accumulate in the blood.

It is manufactured by a number of companies worldwide under several brand names. In the United States it was first approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1995. Lansoprazole has been available as a generic drug since Prevacid patent protection expired on November 10, 2009. Since 2009 Lansoprazole has been available over the counter (OTC) in the U.S. in a 15Â mg dose marketed by Novartis as Prevacid 24HR. Main article: Proton-pump inhibitor Lansoprazole is a proton-pump inhibitor (PPI) in the same pharmacologic class as omeprazole. Lansoprazole has been marketed for many years and is one of several PPIs available. Lansoprazole is a racemate [1:1-mixture of the enantiomers dexlansoprazole (Kapidex) and levolansoprazole]. Dexlansoprazole is an enantiomerically pure active ingredient of a commercial drug as a result of the 'enantiomeric shift'. Lansoprazole's plasma elimination half-life is not proportional to the duration of the drug's effects to the person (i.e. gastric acid suppression). The mean plasma elimination half-life is 1.5 hours, and the effects of the drug last for over 24 hours after it has been used for 1 day or more. Lansoprazole, 30Â mg administered nasogastrically, effectively controls intragastric pH and is an alternative to i.v. pantoprazole in patients who are unable to swallow solid dosage formulations.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dihydrocodeine	Dihydrocodeine	5284543	DB01551	N9I9HDB855	125-28-0		Oral, subcutaneous, I.M., rectal, possiblly sublingual/buccal	Mainly hepatic, through CYP3A4 and CYP2D6	Dihydrocodeine is a semi-synthetic opioid analgesic prescribed for pain, severe dyspnea, or as an antitussive, either alone or compounded with aspirin or paracetamol, as in co-dydramol. It was developed in Germany in 1908 and put on the market in 1911. Dihydrocodeine is also known as DHC, Drocode, Paracodeine and Parzone and known by the brand names of Synalgos DC, Panlor DC, Panlor SS, Contugesic, New Bron Solution-ACE, Huscode, Drocode, Paracodin, Codidol, Dehace, Didor Continus, Dicogesic, Codhydrine, Dekacodin, DH-Codeine, Didrate, Dihydrin, Hydrocodin, Nadeine, Novicodin, Rapacodin, Fortuss, Remedeine, Dico and DF-118 amongst others (e.g. Paramol), Commonly available as tablets, solutions, elixirs, and other oral forms, dihydrocodeine is also available in some countries as an injectable solution for deep subcutaneous and intra-muscular administration. As with codeine, intravenous administration should be avoided, as it could result in anaphylaxis and dangerous pulmonary edema. In past times, dihydrocodeine suppositories were used; however, dihydrocodeine is available in suppository form on prescription. Dihydrocodeine is used as an alternative or adjunct to codeine for the aforementioned indications. It is available as the following salts, in rough descending order of frequency of use: bitartrate, phosphate, hydrochloride, tartrate, hydroiodide, methyliodide, hydrobromide, and sulfate. The salt to free base conversion factors are 0.67 for the bitartrate, 0.73 for the phosphate, and 0.89 for the hydrochloride. Dihydrocodeine was developed during the intense international search for more effective antitussives, especially to help reduce the airborne spread of tuberculosis, pertussis, pneumonia, and similar diseases, in the years from c.a. 1895 to 1915, and is similar in chemical structure to codeine. Depending on individual metabolism, dihydrocodeine is 100 to 150 percent as strong as codeine. Although dihydrocodeine does have extremely active metabolites, in the form of dihydromorphine and dihydromorphine-6-glucuronide (one hundred times more potent), these metabolites are produced in such small amount that they do not have clinically important effects. Dihydrocodeine is also the original member and chemical base of a number of similar semi-synthetic opiates such as acetyldihydrocodeine, dihydrocodeine enol acetate, dihydroisocodeine, nicocodeine, and nicodicodeine.

It was developed as a successor of and alternative to terfenadine (trade names include Triludan and Seldane), an antihistamine that caused QT interval prolongation, potentially leading to cardiac arrhythmia. Fexofenadine, like other second- and third-generation antihistamines, does not readily cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier, and so causes less drowsiness than first-generation histamine-receptor antagonists. It works by being an antagonist to the H1 receptor. It has been variously described as either a second-generation or a third-generation antihistamine.

Its spectrum of activity includes most strains of bacterial pathogens responsible for respiratory, urinary tract, gastrointestinal, and abdominal infections, including Gram-(-), Gram-(+), and atypical bacterial pathogens. Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are valued for this broad spectrum of activity, excellent tissue penetration, and for their availability in both oral and intravenous formulations. (Many antibacterials used in serious infections must be dosed intravenously. ) Levaquin is used alone or in combination with other antibacterial drugs to treat certain bacterial infections including pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and abdominal infections. Levofloxacin is a chiral fluorinated carboxyquinolone. Investigation of ofloxacin, an older drug that is the racemic mixture, found that the (â€“)-(S) enantiomer (also known as the S isomer) is more active. This specific component is levofloxacin. Levofloxacin and other fluoroquinolones are generally well tolerated, but in rare instances have produced serious and life-threatening adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Tendon damage may manifest months after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities. Other controversies associated with this drug include increasing resistance due to their overuse. This overuse includes situations in which antibiotic therapy is unnecessary, and others in which the use of a less broad spectrum agent would produce equivalent results. As of 2011, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added two Black box warnings for this drug in reference to spontaneous tendon ruptures and the fact that levofloxacin may cause worsening of myasthenia gravis symptoms, including muscle weakness and breathing problems. Such an adverse reaction is a potentially life-threatening event and may require ventilatory support.

Paracetamol is classified as a mild analgesic. It is commonly used for the relief of headaches and other minor aches and pains and is a major ingredient in numerous cold and flu remedies. In combination with opioid analgesics, paracetamol can also be used in the management of more severe pain such as post-surgical pain and providing palliative care in advanced cancer patients. Though acetaminophen is used to treat inflammatory pain, it is not generally classified as an NSAID because it exhibits only weak anti-inflammatory activity. The onset of analgesia is approximately 11 minutes after oral administration of paracetamol, and its half-life is 1â€“4 hours. While generally safe for use at recommended doses (1,000 mg per single dose and up to 4,000 mg per day for adults), acute overdoses of paracetamol can cause potentially fatal kidney, brain and liver damage and, in rare individuals, a normal dose can do the same. The risk may be heightened by chronic alcohol abuse. Paracetamol toxicity is the foremost cause of acute liver failure in the Western world, and accounts for most drug overdoses in the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. It is the active metabolite of the coal tar-derived phenacetin, once popular as an analgesic and antipyretic in its own right. However, unlike phenacetin and its combinations, paracetamol is not considered carcinogenic at therapeutic doses. The words acetaminophen (used in the United States, Canada, Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, and Iran) and paracetamol (used elsewhere) both come from a chemical name for the compound: para-acetylaminophenol and para-acetylaminophenol.

The drug has a wide range of applications, including treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, restless legs syndrome, motor neurone disease and fibromyalgia. It was launched and marketed as Tramal by the German pharmaceutical company GrÃ¼nenthal GmbH in 1977. Tramadol is a very weak Î¼-opioid receptor agonist, induces serotonin release, and inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine. Tramadol is converted to O-desmethyltramadol, a significantly more potent Î¼-opioid agonist. The opioid agonistic effect of tramadol and its major metabolite(s) is almost exclusively mediated by such Î¼-opioid receptors. This further distinguishes tramadol from opioids in general, which do not possess tramadol's degree of receptor subtype selectivity and which are much stronger opiate-receptor agonists. Similarly, the habituating properties of tramadol (such as they are) are arguably mainly due to Î¼-opioid agonism with contributions from serotonergic and noradrenergic effects.

The drug was test marketed in the United States by Hoechst AG, i.e. a drug that increases the amount of synaptic norepinephrine and dopamine available to receptors by blocking the dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake transporters. This is a mechanism of action shared by some recreational drugs like cocaine, and currently-available antidepressants. Nomifensine was investigated for use as an antidepressant in the 1970s, and was found to be a useful antidepressant at doses of 50â€“225Â mg per day, both motivating and anxiolytic. There were relatively few adverse effects (mainly dry mouth, headache, nausea), the drug was not sedating, did not interact significantly with alcohol and lacked anticholinergic effects. No withdrawal symptoms were seen after 6 months treatment. The drug was however considered not suitable for agitated patients as it presumably made agitation worse. Some case reports in the 1980s suggested that there was potential for psychological dependence on nomifensine, typically in patients with a history of stimulant addiction, or when the drug was used in very high doses (400â€“600Â mg per day). In a 1989 study it has been investigated for use in treating adult ADHD and proven successful. In a 1977 study it has not proven of benefit in advanced parkinsonism, except for depression associated with the parkinsonism. Due to the risk of a risk of haemolytic anaemia, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) withdrew approval for nomifensine on March 20, 1992. Nomifensine has subsequently been withdrawn from the Canadian and UK markets as well. Some deaths were linked to immunohaemolytic anemia caused by this compound although the mechanism remained unclear. In 2012 structureâ€“affinity relationship data were published.

Spectimomycin is produced in nature by many organisms including cyanobacteria and various plant species. It is present in the genome or plastome of many plastids as the spc operon, which is usually 2-10 amino acids long (this has been known to vary). The difference in size may be due to the elimination of obsolete genes or the takeover of its function by nuclear genes. Spectinomycin is mainly produced by organisms as a defence mechanism against predators.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulfanilamide	Sulfanilamide	5333	DB00259	21240MF57M	63-74-1				"Sulfanilamide (also spelled sulphanilamide) is a sulfonamide antibacterial. Chemically, it is a molecule containing the sulfonamide functional group attached to an aniline. As a sulfonamide antibiotic, it functions by competitively inhibiting (i.e. , by acting as a substrate analogue) enzymatic reactions involving para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA). PABA is needed in enzymatic reactions that produce folic acid which acts as a coenzyme in the synthesis of purine, pyrimidine and other amino acids. The term ""sulfanilamides"" is also used to describe a family of molecules containing these functional groups. Examples include: Furosemide, a loop diuretic Sulfadiazine, an antibiotic Sulfamethoxazole, an antibiotic Gerhard Domagk, who directed the testing of the prodrug Prontosil in 1935, and Jacques and ThÃ©rÃ¨se TrÃ©fouÃ«l, who along with Federico Nitti and Daniel Bovet in the laboratory of Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute, determined sulfanilamide as the active form, are generally credited with the discovery of sulfanilamide as a chemotherapeutic agent. Domagk was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bevacizumab	Bevacizumab		BTD00087	2S9ZZM9Q9V	216974-75-3		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		Bevacizumab is an angiogenesis inhibitor, a drug that slows the growth of new blood vessels. It is licensed to treat various cancers, including colorectal, lung, breast (outside the USA), glioblastoma (USA only), kidney and ovarian. Bevacizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). VEGF-A is a chemical signal that stimulates angiogenesis in a variety of diseases, especially in cancer. Bevacizumab was the first clinically available angiogenesis inhibitor in the United States. Bevacizumab was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for certain metastatic cancers. It received its first approval in 2004, for combination use with standard chemotherapy for metastatic colon cancer. It has since been approved for use in certain lung cancers, renal cancers, and glioblastoma multiforme of the brain. At one point bevacizumab was approved for breast cancer by the FDA, but the approval was revoked on 18 November 2011. The approval for breast cancer was revoked because, although there was evidence that it slowed progression of metastatic breast cancer, there was no evidence that it extended life or improved quality of life, and it caused adverse effects including severe high blood pressure and hemorrhaging. In 2008, the FDA gave bevacizumab provisional approval for metastatic breast cancer, subject to further studies. The FDA's advisory panel had recommended against approval. In July 2010, after new studies failed to show a significant benefit, the FDA's advisory panel recommended against the indication for advanced breast cancer. Genentech requested a hearing, which was granted in June 2011. The FDA ruled to withdraw the breast cancer indication in November 2011. FDA approval is required for Genentech to market a drug for that indication. Doctors may sometimes prescribe it for that indication, although insurance companies are less likely to pay for it. The drug remains approved for breast cancer use in other countries including Australia. Clinical trials are underway for many other indications including ovarian cancer, pediatric osteosarcoma, and certain non-malignant eye diseases. In the curative setting, clinical studies are underway in breast cancer and lung cancer.

Its primary clinical applications include treatment of osteoporosis and anaemia, as well as stimulating muscle growth in malnourished or underdeveloped patients. The drug was approved for human use by the FDA. Later, non-steroidal drugs such as epoetin alfa were developed and proven to be more effective as a treatment for anaemia and osteoporosis without the side effects of oxymetholone. The drug remained available despite this and eventually found a new use in treating HIV wasting syndrome. Presented most commonly as a 50 mg tablet, oxymetholone is one of the strongest androgenic steroids available. Similarly, it also poses the greatest risk of side effects of any steroid. Despite very low binding affinity with the androgen receptor, oxymetholone is highly effective in promoting extensive gains in body mass, mostly by greatly improving protein synthesis. For this reason, it is often used by bodybuilders and athletes. Many athletes also use oxymetholone as a method of protection for the joints under heavy loads. Oxymetholone is widely considered by bodybuilders to have the strongest anabolic effect out of all oral steroids available.

Phenylethylamine functions as a neuromodulator or neurotransmitter in the mammalian central nervous system. It is biosynthesized from the amino acid phenylalanine by enzymatic decarboxylation. In addition to its presence in mammals, phenethylamine is found in many other organisms and foods, such as chocolate, especially after microbial fermentation. It is sold as a dietary supplement for purported mood and weight loss-related therapeutic benefits; however, orally ingested phenethylamine is usually inactive because of extensive first-pass metabolism by monoamine oxidase (MAO) into phenylacetic acid. This prevents significant concentrations from reaching the brain. The group of phenethylamine derivatives is referred to as the phenethylamines. Substituted phenethylamines, substituted amphetamines, and substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamines (MDxx) are a series of broad and diverse classes of compounds derived from phenethylamine that include stimulants, psychedelics, and entactogens, as well as anorectics, bronchodilators, decongestants, and antidepressants, among others.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyrovalerone	Pyrovalerone	14373		VOU69C02JP	3563-49-3		Oral		Pyrovalerone (Centroton, 4-Methyl-Î²-ketone-prolintane, Thymergix, O-2371) is a psychoactive drug with stimulant effects via acting as a norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), and is used for the clinical treatment of chronic fatigue or lethargy and as an anorectic or appetite suppressant for weight loss purposes. It was developed in the late 1960s and has since been used in France and several other European countries. Though pyrovalerone is still occasionally prescribed, it is used infrequently due to problems with abuse and dependence. Pyrovalerone is a Schedule V controlled substance in the United States (U.S. ), and is the only stimulant in that category. In Britain, it is in the Class C category and In Australia it is a Schedule 4 substance. It is closely related on a structural level to a number of other stimulants, such as MDPV and prolintane (Promotil, Katovit). Side effects of pyrovalerone include anorexia or loss of appetite, anxiety, fragmented sleep or insomnia, and trembling, shaking, or muscle tremors. Withdrawal following abuse upon discontinuation often results in depression. The R-enantiomer of pyrovalerone is devoid of activity.

Human clinical trials showed the product to be superior to other iodine formulations. It was first sold in 1955, and has since become the universally preferred iodine antiseptic.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Florfenicol	Florfenicol	114811		9J97307Y1H	73231-34-2		intramuscular, subcutaneous		Florfenicol (marketed by Schering-Plough Animal Health under the trade name Nuflor) is a fluorinated synthetic analog of thiamphenicol. In the United States, florfenicol is currently indicated for the treatment of bovine respiratory disease (BRD) associated with Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida, and Haemophilus somnus, for treatment of bovine interdigital phlegmon (foot rot, acute interdigital necrobacillosis, infectious pododermatitis) associated with Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. The use of florfenicol in horses, and likely in other equids, typically causes diarrhea. This has been anecdotally reported to progress to lethal cases of acute colitis. Therefore, use of this antimicrobial in the equine patient should be limited to cases in which other, safer, options are not available.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tirapazamine	Tirapazamine	33776		1UD32YR59G	27314-97-2				Tirapazamine (SR-4233) is an experimental anticancer drug that is activated to a toxic radical only at very low levels of oxygen. Such levels are common in human solid tumors, a phenomenon known as tumor hypoxia. Thus, tirapazamine is activated to its toxic form preferentially in the hypoxic areas of solid tumors. Cells in these regions are resistant to killing by radiotherapy and most anticancer drugs. Thus the combination of tirapazamine with conventional anticancer treatments is particularly effective. As of 2006, tirapazamine is undergoing phase III testing in patients with head and neck cancer and gynecological cancer, and similar trials are being undertaken for other solid tumor types. Chemically it is an aromatic heterocycle di-N-oxide. Its full chemical name is 3-amino-1,2,4-benzotriazine-1,4 dioxide. Originally it was prepared in a programme screening for new herbicides in 1972. Its clinical use was first described by Zeman et al. in 1986. While tirapazamine has had only limited effectiveness in clinical trials, it has been used as a lead compound to develop a number of newer compounds with improved anti-cancer properties. An update of a Phase III trial found no evidence that the addition of TPZ to chemoradiotherapy, in patients with advanced head and neck cancer not selected for the presence of hypoxia, improved overall survival.

It is a natural metabolite of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) via the 5Î±-reductase enzyme. It was first isolated in 1931, by Adolf Friedrich Johann Butenandt and Kurt Tscherning. They distilled over 17,000 litres of male urine, from which they got 50 milligrams of crystalline androsterone (most likely mixed isomers), which was sufficient to find that the chemical formula was very similar to estrone. Epiandrosterone has been shown to naturally occur in most mammals including pigs. Epiandrosterone is naturally produced by the enzyme 5Î±-reductase from the adrenal hormone DHEA. Epiandrosterone can also be converted from the natural steroids androstanediol via 17Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase or from androstanedione via 3Î²-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase.

It is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the Î±4Î²2 subtype. It has nootropic effects and was originally developed as a potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease, but a second action that was subsequently found was that it inhibits the production of Interleukin-8 and thus produces an antiinflammatory effect, and so it has also been developed as a potential treatment for ulcerative colitis. Rivanicline also has stimulant and analgesic actions which are thought to be mediated through stimulation of noradrenaline release, and so it could potentially also have other applications.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/CX-516	CX-516	148184		Z5QU38B4V9	154235-83-3				CX-516 is an ampakine and nootropic that acts as an AMPA receptor positive allosteric modulator and is being developed by a collaboration of Cortex and Shire and Servier. It was researched as a treatment for Alzheimer's disease under the brand name Ampalex, and was also being examined as a treatment for ADHD. CX-516 was the first ampakine compound developed by Cortex and while it showed good in vitro activity and positive results in animal tests, the human trials proved disappointing due mainly to low potency and short half-life. However, CX-516 is still widely used in animal research into the ampakine drugs and is the standard reference compound that newer, more potent drugs of this class such as farampator and CX-717 are compared to.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/CX-546	CX-546	2890		PV6YEC8983	215923-54-9				CX-546 is an ampakine drug developed by Cortex Pharmaceuticals. It has been proposed as a treatment for schizophrenia. CX-546 was the second drug of note to come out of the Cortex research program, after CX-516, but while it was an improvement over its predecessor in some respects, it still has problems with limited oral bioavailability. However CX-546 still represented a significant advance that led on to the development of newer compounds such as CX-614 and CX-717 with superior properties over the earlier drugs. CX-546 itself has been investigated for other applications, and most notably has been found to show significant efficacy in reversing the respiratory depression produced by sedative drugs such as opioids and barbiturates. No effective respiratory stimulants are currently marketed for this application, with CX-546 being only the third drug discovered that effectively relieves the respiratory depression induced by fentanyl without reducing the analgesic effects. CX-546 could be developed for this purpose, although it is more likely Cortex will use newer and more potent analogues such as CX-1739 or CX-1763 which are likely to be more suitable for commercial development. http://www. wallstreet-online. de/community/thread/940011-26. html

It has neuroprotective, analgesic, and anti-Parkinsonian effects in animal studies. Traxoprodil has been researched in humans as a potential treatment to lessen the damage to the brain after stroke, but results from clinical trials showed only modest benefit. The drug was found to cause EKG abnormalities (QT prolongation) and its clinical development was stopped. More recent animal studies have suggested traxoprodil may exhibit rapid-acting antidepressant effects similar to those of ketamine, although there is some evidence for similar psychoactive side effects and abuse potential at higher doses, which might limit clinical acceptance of traxoprodil for this application.

It has potent anorectic effects in animals, and was researched for the treatment of obesity, although CB1 antagonists as a class have now fallen out of favour as potential anorectics following the problems seen with rimonabant, and so ibipinabant is now only used for laboratory research, especially structure-activity relationship studies into novel CB1 antagonists.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fibrinolysin	Fibrinolysin			A4028U842W	9001-90-5		ointment for local application, in combination with desoxyribonuclease	local inactivation	Fibrinolysin is an enzyme derived from plasma of bovine origin or extracted from cultures of certain bacteria. It is used locally only and exclusively together with the enzyme desoxyribonuclease (extracted from bovine pancreas). Fibrinolysin and desoxyribonuclease both act as lytic enzymes. The combination is available as ointment containing 1 BU (Biological Unit) fibrinolysin and 666 BUs desoxyribonuclease per gram. Fibrinolysin attacks and inactivates fibrin molecules occurring in undesirable exudates on the surface of the human body and on human mucosa, e.g. , in superficial wounds and burns, while desoxyribonuclease targets and destroys (human) DNA. The combination of the two enzymes has a synergistic effect on necrotic but not on living tissue. According to the manufacturer the ointment provides enhanced wound cleaning and accelerates the healing process. Both enzymes are marginally resorbed into systemic circulation because of their very high molecular weight and their macromolecular structure. The activity of both enzymes is almost completely exhausted after 24 hours. Usually, it is necessary to repeat the application (and renew the dressing) every 6 to 8 hours until healing becomes complete. The ointment is marketed by Pfizer under the brand name Fibrolan in a variety of countries (e.g. Switzerland). It is currently not approved in the USA. Where approved, Fibrolan has been licensed on the basis of claimed good therapeutical experience, but adequate and well controlled studies are still lacking. In the past, combinations with the antibiotic chloramphenicol were available, but because chloramphenicol in any form of application has led to aplastic anemia and death, these were banned. Additionally, combinations with the antifibrinolytic agent tranexamic acid have been withdrawn from pharmaceutic markets.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methylenedioxyphenethylamine	Methylenedioxyphenethylamine	73874	?		1484-85-1		Various	?	3,4-Methylenedioxyphenethylamine (MDPEA), also known as homopiperonylamine, is a substituted phenethylamine formed by adding a methylenedioxy group to phenethylamine. It is structurally similar to MDA, but without the methyl group at the alpha position. According to Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL, MDPEA appears to be biologically inactive. This is likely because of extensive first-pass metabolism by the enzyme monoamine oxidase. However, if MDPEA were either used in high enough of doses (e.g. , 1-2 grams), or in combination with a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), it is probable that it would become sufficiently active, though it would likely have a relatively short duration of action. This idea is similar in concept to the use of selective MAOA inhibitors and selective MAOB inhibitors in augmentation of dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and phenethylamine (PEA), respectively.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Prostaglandin_E2	Prostaglandin E2	9691	DB00917		363-24-6				The naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) is known in medicine as dinoprostone. It has important effects in labour (softens cervix and causes uterine contraction) and also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors that stimulate bone resorption by osteoclasts. PGE2 is also the prostaglandin that ultimately induces fever. It is sold under the trade name of Cervidil, Prostin E2, Propess and Glandin as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour; it is used to induce labour. Like other prostaglandins, dinoprostone can be used as an abortifacient. It is a direct vasodilator, relaxing smooth muscles, and it inhibits the release of noradrenaline from sympathetic nerve terminals. It does not inhibit platelet aggregation, where PGI2 does. It works by binding and activating the prostaglandin E2 receptor. It was discovered by Bunting, Gryglewski, Moncada and Vane in 1976. Up-regulation of PGE2 has been implicated as a possible etiology of nail clubbing.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/6-Monoacetylmorphine	6-Monoacetylmorphine	5462507			2784-73-8		Intravenous		6-Monoacetylmorphine (6-MAM) or 6-acetylmorphine is one of three active metabolites of heroin (diacetylmorphine), the others being morphine and the much less active 3-monoacetylmorphine (3-MAM). 6-MAM is rapidly created from heroin in the body, and then is either metabolized into morphine or excreted in the urine. Since 6-MAM is a unique metabolite to heroin, its presence in the urine confirms that heroin was the opioid used. This is significant because on a urine immunoassay drug screen, the test typically tests for morphine, which is a metabolite of a number of legal and illegal opiates/opioids such as codeine, morphine sulfate, and heroin. 6-MAM remains in the urine for no more than 24 hours so a urine specimen must be collected soon after the last heroin use, but the presence of 6-MAM guarantees that heroin was in fact used as recently as within the last day. 6-MAM is naturally found in the brain, but in such small quantities that detection of this compound in urine virtually guarantees that heroin has recently been consumed. Heroin is rapidly metabolized by esterase enzymes in the brain and has an extremely short half-life. It has also relatively weak affinity to Î¼-opioid receptors because the 3-hydroxy group which is essential for effective binding to the receptor is masked by the acetyl group. Therefore, heroin is simply a pro-drug, serving as a lipophilic transporter of sorts for the systemic delivery of morphine, which actively binds with Î¼-opioid receptors. 6-MAM already has a free 3-hydroxy group and shares the high lipophilicity of heroin, so it penetrates the brain just as quickly and does not need to be deacetylated at the 3-position in order to be bioactivated; this makes 6-monoacetylmorphine somewhat more potent than heroin, but it is rarely encountered as an illicit drug due to the difficulty in selectively acetylating morphine at the 6-position without also acetylating the 3-position. This can however be accomplished by using acetic acid with an appropriate catalyst to carry out the acetylation,{http://acs. confex. com/acs/56serm/techprogram/P13571. HTM} rather than acetic anhydride, as acetic acid is not a strong enough acetylating agent to acetylate the phenolic 3-hydroxy group but is able to acetylate the 6-hydroxy group, thus selectively producing 6-MAM rather than heroin. The process used in creating black tar heroin actually leaves 6-MAM in the final product, which is one of several reasons why black tar, even when less pure, may be more potent than some powder varieties of heroin.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/PUGNAc	PUGNAc	9576811			132489-69-1		Oral		PUGNAc is a 1,5-hydroximolactone, acting as an inhibitor of a variety of N-acetylhexosaminidases. It was long thought that increased levels of O-GlcNAc in human cells lead to Type II diabetes. O-GlcNAc levels were artificially raised with PUGNAc, which inhibits O-GlcNAcase, a beta-exo-N-acetylhexosaminidase which cleaves beta-O-linked-N-acetylglucosamine residues from glycoproteins. As a result of this inhibition, a type II diabetic phenotype was observed. Recent pharmacological studies using a more selective O-GlcNAcase inhibitor did not see this effect. However, genetic manipulation of O-GlcNAc levels is consistent with the effects observed by PUGNAc, namely insulin resistance upon elevation of O-GlcNAc levels.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rember	Rember	6099			61-73-4		oral		Methylthioninium chloride (INN, or methylene blue, proposed trade name Rember) is an investigational drug being developed by the University of Aberdeen and TauRx Therapeutics that has been shown in early clinical trials to be an inhibitor of Tau protein aggregation. The drug is of potential interest for the treatment of patients with Alzheimer's disease. Its development appears to be related to claim 7 of US 6953794Â  Inhibition of Tau-Tau Association. TauRx Therapeutics has suggested that the mechanism by which methylene blue might delay or reverse neurodegeneration in Alzheimer's disease is as an inhibitor of Tau protein aggregation. While methylene blue arguably has an effect on Tau aggregation, it also has an effect on mitochondrial function which is likely to play an important role. In vitro studies suggest that methylene blue might be an effective remedy for both Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease by enhancing key mitochondrial biochemical pathways. It can disinhibit and increase complex IV, whose inhibition correlates with Alzheimer's disease.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alpha-Methylserotonin	Alpha-Methylserotonin	2107			304-52-9		Oral		Alpha-Methylserotonin Î±-Methylserotonin (Î±MS), also known as Î±-methyl-5-hydroxytryptamine (Î±-methyl-5-HT) or 5-hydroxy-Î±-methyltryptamine (5-HO-Î±MT), is a tryptamine derivative closely related to the neurotransmitter serotonin (5-HT). It acts as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist and has been used extensively in scientific research to study the function of the serotonin system. Unlike serotonin, Î±MS is not metabolized by monoamine oxidase on account of the Î±-methyl substituent blocking the enzyme access to the amine, and as a result, it has a much longer half-life in comparison. Similarly to serotonin, however, Î±MS poorly crosses the blood-brain-barrier due to its free hydroxyl group, and thus has only weak or no mental effects. Î±-Methyltryptophan (Î±MTP) is a prodrug to Î±MS which does cross the blood-brain-barrier and thus efficiently delivers Î±MS into the central nervous system. As a result, Î±MTP acts as an orally bioavailable false or substitute neurotransmitter for serotonin, and has been suggested as a therapeutic agent in the treatment of disorders where serotonin is deficient. The O-methylated analogue of Î±MS, 5-MeO-Î±MT, also readily enters the brain and may be used for this purpose as well.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hemicholinium-3	Hemicholinium-3	9399			312-45-8				Hemicholinium-3 (HC3), also known as hemicholine, is a drug which blocks the reuptake of choline by the high-affinity choline transporter (ChT; encoded in humans by the gene SLC5A7) at the presynapse. The reuptake of choline is the rate limiting step in the synthesis of acetylcholine; hence, hemicholinium-3 decreases the synthesis of acetylcholine. It is therefore classified as an indirect acetylcholine antagonist. Acetylcholine is synthesized from choline and a donated acetyl group from acetyl-CoA, by the action of choline acetyltransferase (ChAT). Thus, decreasing the amount of choline available to a neuron will decrease the amount of acetylcholine produced. Neurons affected by hemicholinium-3 must rely on the transport of choline from the soma (cell body), rather than relying on reuptake of choline from the synaptic cleft.

It exhibits cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells, Gram-positive bacteria, yeast, and fungi, as well as hemolytic activity; this is mediated by changes at the cell membrane and subsequent lysis. Owing to its cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells and tumors, it was first proposed as an antitumor antibiotic. As of 2007, it has not been used in a clinical setting.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Isosorbide_dinitrate/hydralazine	Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine	9843669			682335-44-0				Isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine is a fixed dose combination drug treatment specifically indicated for African Americans with congestive heart failure. It is a combination of hydralazine and isosorbide dinitrate. It is the first race-based prescription drug in the United States. The combination preparation is marketed in the United States by Arbor Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (who purchased the rights to market the drug in December 2011 from NitroMed) under the trade name BiDil. Originally rejected by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1997, the combination preparation was approved by the FDA in June 2005 for use in African Americans. It was already known that African-American blacks with congestive heart failure (CHF) respond less effectively to conventional CHF treatments than Caucasians. The study by Taylor et al. , based on which the FDA approved the medication demonstrated that isosorbide dinitrate with hydralazine reduced mortality by 43%, reduced hospitalizations by 39%, and improved quality of life markers in African-American patients with CHF. Because the combination preparation comprises two generically-available drugs, widely available at a small fraction of the cost, BiDil is considered a marketing innovation, rather than a medical one; however, the 43% mortality benefit remains a notable benefit. Though BiDil must still be taken three times daily, as must the component pills in separate ISDN-H treatment, the reduction in pill burden has been suggested to improve compliance, and thus a better medical outcome. The FDA issued a letter in May, 2006 stating that there is no bioequivalent, generic substitute to BiDil. With the 2005 FDA approval and with the issuance of a patent, BiDil is unique and no alternative therapy exists for the target patient population. In 2006, the Heart Failure Society of America included the use of the fixed dose combination of isosorbide dinitrate/hydralazine as the standard of care in the treatment of heart failure in blacks. In 2007, at the American College of Cardiology's annual scientific meeting in New Orleans, data was presented demonstrating a pharmacokenetic distinction between the fixed dose combination and the component agents that may account for the superior clinical benefit in mortality shown in the African American Heart Failure Trial. There is, however, concern that the approval of this drug may be used to promote racist thinking, especially because the study data used to approve the medication only included self-described African-American participants and no other racial groups. BiDil could potentially be beneficial to all patients suffering from heart failure, even if not to the same statistically different extent compared to existing medications (that already provide benefit in racial groups other than African-American blacks).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Levofenfluramine	Levofenfluramine	65801			37577-24-5				Levofenfluramine, or (-)-3-trifluoromethyl-N-ethylamphetamine, also known as (-)-fenfluramine or (R)-fenfluramine, is a drug of the amphetamine family that, itself, was never marketed. It is the levorotatory enantiomer of fenfluramine, the racemic form of the compound, whereas the dextrorotatory enantiomer is dexfenfluramine. Both fenfluramine and dexfenfluramine are anorectic agents that have been used clinically in the treatment of obesity (and hence, levofenfluramine has been as well since it is a component of fenfluramine). However, they have since been discontinued due to reports of causing cardiovascular conditions such as valvular heart disease and pulmonary hypertension, adverse effects that are likely to be caused by excessive stimulation of 5-HT2B receptors expressed on heart valves. Dexfenfluramine is believed to be solely responsible for the appetite suppressant properties of fenfluramine, of which it has been demonstrated to mediate predominantly via activation of postsynaptic 5-HT1B and 5-HT2C receptors through a combination of indirect serotonin releasing agent and direct serotonin receptor agonist activities (the latter of which are mediated fully by its active metabolite dexnorfenfluramine). Contrarily, levofenfluramine is thought to contribute only to unwanted side effects. Paradoxically, however, it has been shown that levofenfluramine too acts as a relatively potent releaser of serotonin, though with approximately 1/3rd of the efficacy of dexfenfluramine, As such, it would be expected to possess some degree of appetite suppressant properties as well, yet it does not. A potential explanation as to why levofenfluramine is not similarly an effective anorectic is that, interestingly, it has also been found to behave as a dopamine receptor antagonist, which, as dopamine antagonists like atypical antipsychotics are associated with causing increased appetite and weight gainâ€”effects that their actions on dopamine receptors have been implicated in playing a role in the development of, is an action that could in theory cancel out the hypothetical serotonergically-mediated appetite suppressant effects of the compound. Of course, this is merely speculation and has not been proven however. Levonorfenfluramine, an active metabolite of levofenfluramine, is also a fairly potent serotonin releasing agent (with a potency of approximately 1/2 that of norfenfluramine and 1/6th that of dexfenfluramine) and, similarly to dexnorfenfluramine, 5-HT2B and 5-HT2C receptor agonist, as well as a somewhat less potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (about 1/2 that of its efficacy as a serotonin releaser). As such, likely contributes significantly to the biological activityâ€”though not necessarily appetite suppressant effectsâ€”of not only levofenfluramine but of racemic fenfluramine as well. Mentionably, in contrast to levonorfenfluramine, levofenfluramine is virtually inactive as a reuptake inhibitor or releaser of norepinephrine, and neither compound has any effect on dopamine reuptake or release.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/TDIQ	TDIQ	2752332			15052-05-8				TDIQ (also known as 6,7-Methylenedioxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline or MDTHIQ) is a drug used in scientific research, which has anxiolytic and anorectic effects in animals. It has an unusual effects profile in animals, with the effects generalising to cocaine and partially to MDMA and ephedrine, but the effects did not generalise to amphetamine and TDIQ does not have any stimulant effects. It is thought these effects are mediated via a partial agonist action at Alpha-2 adrenergic receptors, and TDIQ has been suggested as a possible drug for the treatment of cocaine dependence.

In animal studies, THIQ stimulated sexual activity in rats, but with little effect on appetite or inflammation. This supports possible application of MC4 selective agonists for the treatment of sexual dysfunction in humans, although THIQ itself has poor oral bioavailability and a short duration of action so improved analogues will need to be developed.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tetrahydrocannabinolic_acid	Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid	98523			23978-85-0				Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA, 2-COOH-THC), is a biosynthetic precursor of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the active component of Cannabis. THCA is found in variable quantities in fresh, undried cannabis, but is progressively decarboxylated to THC with drying, and especially under intense heating such as when cannabis is smoked. While THCA does not have psychoactive effects in its own right, it does have antiinflammatory and neuroprotective effects. Despite the ready decarboxylation by drying or heating ex vivo, conversion of THCA to THC in vivo appears to be very limited, giving it only very slight efficacy as a prodrug for THC. Consequently it is believed to be important in less-psychoactive preparations of cannabis used for medical use, such as cannabis tea. It is also commonly used as a biomarker in drug testing along with THCV, to distinguish between prescribed processed forms of medicinal cannabis such as Marinol, and cannabis plant material which may also be used by patients.

It is the only selective full agonist for the Î±-adrenergic receptors known to date and has been used to study their function in scientific research. Infusion of 6-FNE into the locus coeruleus of rodents produces marked hyperactivity and behavioral disinhibition by suppressing activity in the area via stimulation of Î±1-adrenergic receptors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alpha-Methyldopamine	Alpha-Methyldopamine	17005			555-64-6				Î±-Methyldopamine (Î±-Me-DA), also known as 3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (3,4-DHA), is a neurotoxin and research chemical of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. It is a metabolite of various amphetamine derivatives such as amphetamine itself, methamphetamine, MDA, and MDMA and has been suggested to play significant role in their neurotoxic effects on monoaminergic neurons. Further study has suggested that, alpha-methyldopamine itself is not directly responsible for the damaging effects, but a specific reaction between alpha-methyldopamine and one of the body's endogenous antioxidants -glutathione, may produce 2,5-Bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine, which has been demonstrated in laboratory animals to cause the same neurotoxic effects seen by related stimulants and empathogens. The basis of this idea is in the observation that MDA and MDMA may not themselves be responsible for their neurotoxicity, as an intracerebroventricular injection (injection directly into the brain itself) does not appear to cause neurotoxicity. While many studies cite excitotoxicity, or oxidative stress as likely mechanisms, which may be an effect of the chemical itself, this has led to the search for other mechanisms for the observed toxicity of serotonin neurons and subsequent reduction in 5-HT (Serotonin) and 5-HIAA (its major metabolite in the body) in vivo following administration. A common theory follows that a metabolite in the periphery must be responsible, and several have been cited as responsible. Although, alpha-methyldopamine is widely cited as the source of this neurotoxicity in a number of lay sources, McCann, et al. (1991), demonstrated that the major metabolites alpha-methyldopamine (Î±-MeDA) and 3-O-methyl-Î±-methyldopamine (3-O-Me-Î±-MeDA) did not produce neurotoxicity. It was first demonstrated, in 1978, by Conway, et al. and possibly others that, while alpha-methyldopamine caused acute decreases in the levels of neuronal dopamine, in some areas of the brain in excess of 75%, levels returned to baseline within 12 hours, indicating that alpha-methyldopamine would not be responsible for the toxic effects observed. However, the story complicates as alpha-methyldopamine readily oxidizes to the o-quinone and reacts with endogenous antioxidants in the body, such as glutathione (GSH). The mechanism of action behind amphetamines and their related compounds, causes the normally encapsulated neurotransmitters to be released from their oxidative vesicle within the neuron into the reductive environment of the cell cystol. This sudden release of oxidative molecules into the cell puts it under oxidative stress. As Glutathione is the major endogenous anti-oxidant produced in the body to protect against oxidative stress and xenobiotics (foreign compounds), it likely plays at least some role in the neutralization of the suddenly released catecholamines (Dopamine and Norepinephrine), and Serotonin, as well as the breakdown of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, and other MDxx compounds. It was demonstrated by Miller, et al. (1997), that 5-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine and 5-(N-acetylcystein-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine produced similar effects to the parent compound, but did not induce neurotoxicity. Another related compound however, 2,5-bis-(glutathion-S-yl)-alpha-methyldopamine, did in fact induce neurotoxicity, providing initial evidence that this metabolite may be the source of neuronal toxicity following the administration of MDA and MDMA, and the subsequent reduction in 5-HT (Serotonin) axons.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/BAY_73-6691	BAY 73-6691	16078952			794568-92-6				BAY 73-6691 is a drug developed by Bayer for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. It was the first compound developed that acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor selective for the PDE9A subtype. The PDE9A enzyme is expressed primarily in the brain, with high concentrations in the cerebellum, neocortex, striatum, and hippocampus, and acts to limit the cGMP-mediated signal transduction which occurs following glutamate binding to NMDA receptors. Consequently selective PDE9A inhibitors were predicted to prolong intracellular responses to glutamate and enhance glutamate signalling, and since this process is known to be involved in learning and memory, PDE9A inhibitors should have a nootropic effect and may be useful in the treatment of Alzheimer's. Animal studies have confirmed these expectations, and BAY 73-6691 has been shown to improve learning and memory in rats. As the first selective PDE9A inhibitor to be developed, it is also widely used in research into the function of this enzyme subtype. However pre-clinical research is at an early stage and it is not yet known whether BAY 73-6691 will prove suitable to progress to human trials, or if it will remain merely a laboratory research tool.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/%CE%915IA	Î‘5IA	6918451			215874-86-5				Î±5IA (LS-193,268) is a nootropic drug invented in 2004 by a team working for Merck, Sharp and Dohme, which acts as a subtype-selective inverse agonist at the benzodiazepine binding site on the GABAA receptor. It binds to the Î±1, Î±2, Î±3 and Î±5 subtypes, but shows much higher efficacy at the Î±5 subtype, and acts either as a weak partial agonist or inverse agonist at the other subtypes, with its partial agonist effect at Î±2 likely to be responsible for the lack of anxiety produced by this drug when compared to older Î±5-preferring inverse agonists such as L-655,708. The Î±5 subtype is expressed predominantly in the hippocampus, an area of the brain involved with learning and memory, and activation of this subtype is thought to be largely responsible for producing the cognitive side effects displayed by many benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs, such as amnesia and difficulties with learning and memory. This led researchers to conclude that a drug acting as an inverse agonist at this subtype should have the opposite effect and enhance learning and memory. Older non-selective inverse agonists at the benzodiazepine site such as DMCM are associated with a range of other effects including anxiety and convulsions, but because Î±5IA acts specifically at the Î±5 subtype it produces nootropic effects in animal studies, yet without any significant anxiogenic or pro-convulsant effects. This gives Î±5IA the potential to be a useful drug either to be used alongside benzodiazepines to counteract their cognitive side effects, or by itself as a nootropic with possible applications in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Budiodarone	Budiodarone	9833332			335148-45-3				Budiodarone (ATI-2042) is an antiarrhythmic agent and chemical analog of amiodarone that is currently being studied in clinical trials. Amiodarone is considered the most effective antiarrhythmic drug available, but its adverse side effects, including hepatic, pulmonary and thyroid toxicity as well as multiple drug interactions, are discouraging its use. Budiodarone only differs in structure from amiodarone through the presence of a sec-butyl acetate side chain at position 2 of the benzofuran moiety. This side chain allows for budiodarone to have a shorter half-life in the body than amiodarone (7 hours versus 35â€“68 days) which allows it to have a faster onset of action and metabolism while still maintaining similar electrophysiological activity. The faster metabolism of budiodarone allows for fewer adverse side effects than amiodarone principally due to decreased levels of toxicity in the body.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cymserine	Cymserine	9907847			145209-39-8				Cymserine is a drug related to physostigmine, which acts as a reversible cholinesterase inhibitor, with moderate selectivity (15x) for the plasma cholinesterase enzyme butyrylcholinesterase, and relatively weaker inhibition of the more well known acetylcholinesterase enzyme. This gives it a much more specific profile of effects that may be useful for treating Alzheimer's disease without producing side effects like tremor, lacrimation and salivation that are seen with the older non-selective cholinesterase inhibitors currently used for this application, such as donepezil. A number of cymserine derivatives have been developed with much greater selectivity for butyrylcholinesterase, and both cymserine itself and several of its analogues have been tested in animals, and found to increase brain acetylcholine levels and produce nootropic effects, as well as reducing levels of amyloid precursor protein and amyloid beta, which are commonly used biomarkers for the development of Alzheimer's disease.

Two different forms of the drug exist. The first, developed in 1987 and marketed in the United States under the tradename Unasyn, is an intravenous antibiotic. The second, an oral form called sultamicillin, is marketed under the trade name Ampictam outside of the United States. Ampicillin/sulbactam is used to treat infections caused by bacteria resistant to beta-lactam antibiotics. Sulbactam blocks the enzyme which breaks down ampicillin and thereby allows ampicillin to attack and kill the bacteria. Ampicillin/sulbactam is also used when the cause of an infection is not known. Intra-abdominal infections, skin infections, pneumonia, and gynecologic infections. It is active against a wide range of bacterial groups, including Staphylococcus aureus, Enterobacteriaceae, and anaerobic bacteria. Importantly, it is not active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa and should not be used alone when infection with this organism is suspected or known.

It is a so-called triple reuptake inhibitor (TRI), or serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (SNDRI). It is expected to launch sometime around 2011. It is the racemic mixture of DOV 21,947 and its (â€“)-enantiomer. Its IC50 values for SERT, NET, and DAT are Ki 14 nM, 20 nM, and 78 nM, respectively. It is closely related to DOV 102,677 and DOV 21,947, both of which are also being developed in collaboration with Merck. Doses of up to 100mg per day are well tolerated with only nausea, and GI disturbances reported as side effects. This compound does not cause notable shifts in LMA, and is not psychostimulant. The effects are not long-lasting. More recently (see attachment), it appears that the DOV compound may also be useful at increasing weight loss. DOV causes a decrease in circulating triglycerides. The reason for weightloss is not going to be thermogenic or psychostimulant, or chronic decrease appetite. Read article for details.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RWJ-394674	RWJ-394674	10205965							RWJ-394674 is a drug that is used in scientific research. It is a potent, orally active analgesic drug that produces little respiratory depression. RWJ-394674 itself is a potent and selective agonist for Î´-opioid receptors, with a Ki of 0.24 nM at Î´ and 72 nM at Î¼. However once inside the body, RWJ-394674 is dealkylated to its monodesethyl metabolite RWJ-413216, which is a potent agonist at the Î¼-opioid receptor and has less affinity for Î´ (Ki 0.26 nM at Î¼, 46.7 nM at Î´). The effect of RWJ-394674 when administered in vivo thus produces potent agonist effects at both Î¼ and Î´ receptors through the combined actions of the parent drug and its active metabolite, with the Î´-agonist effects counteracting the respiratory depression from the Î¼-opioid effects, and the only prominent side-effect being sedation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/CroFab	CroFab								CroFab is the commercial name for a Crotalidae Polyvalent Immune Fab (Ovine) snake antivenom, indicated for minimal or moderate North American Crotalid snake envenomation. It is developed and manufactured by BTG plc (formerly Protherics PLC). Crotalid snakebites can range from mild to life-threatening, depending on the size and type of snake, the amount of venom injected and the location of the bite. This in turn determines the number of vials of CroFab that are required by the patient. Untreated, the snake venom can cause severe pain and tissue damage that can result in the loss of a limb or even death. Prompt (within 6 hours of snake bite) treatment with CroFab is recommended. CroFab has been well received by physicians because of its efficacy and safety profile. This has encouraged doctors to treat more bite victims, including patients with milder bites, as well as to start treatment with CroFab earlier in the course of poisoning to reduce its severity.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rho(D)_immune_globulin	Rho(D) immune globulin								Rho(D) Immune Globulin is a medicine given by intramuscular injection that is used to prevent the immunological condition known as Rhesus disease. The medicine is a solution of IgG anti-D (anti-RhD) antibodies that suppresses the mother's immune system from attacking Rh-positive blood cells which have entered the maternal blood stream from fetal circulation. In a Rhesus negative mother Rho(D) Immune Globulin can prevent temporary sensitization of the maternal immune system to Rh D antigens, which can cause rhesus disease in the current or in subsequent pregnancies. With the widespread use of Rho(D) Immune Globulin, Rh disease of the fetus and newborn has almost disappeared. Rho(D) Immune Globulin is composed of IgG antibodies and therefore is able to cross the placenta. In rare cases this can cause a baby to have a weakly positive DAT due to sensitization of fetal cells from mothers who have received multiple doses of Rho(D) Immune Globulin. However, no treatment is necessary as the clinical course is benign.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tick-borne_encephalitis_vaccine	Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine								Tick-borne encephalitis vaccine is a vaccine used against tick-borne encephalitis (TBE). The vaccine is highly immunogenic, with seroconversion rates of over 87%. The first vaccine against TBE was prepared in 1941 in the brains of mice. Some 20 years later TBE vaccines derived from cell cultures (chicken embryo fibroblast cells) were developed and used for active immunization in humans in the former Soviet Union. Later, a purified, inactivated virus vaccine was developed which proved to be more immunogenic than previous TBE vaccines. The efficacy of these vaccines has been well documented. They have also been shown to protect mice from a lethal challenge with several TBE-virus isolates obtained over a period of more than 30 years from all over Europe and the Asian part of the former Soviet Union. In addition, it has been demonstrated that antibodies induced by vaccination of human volunteers neutralized all tested isolates.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Co-danthrusate	Co-danthrusate								Co-danthrusate is a combination of dantron and docusate. Dantron is a mild peristaltic stimulant which acts on the lower bowel to encourage normal bowel movement without causing irritation. It belongs to the group of medicines under the term stimulant laxative. It stimulates the nerves in the stomach wall which causes the stomach muscles to contract. This medicine is used for analgesic-induced constipation. It takes six to twelve hours to work. This can cause discoloration of urine and bowel and liver tumors. Co-danthramer is dantron plus poloxamer. It is (in the U.K. ) only to be prescribed to terminally ill patients due to carcinogen reactions in rats. It is often prescribed to people taking long term opioid, because it relaxes the effect of opioid induced constipation. It will not alleviate the symptoms of opioid induced delayed gastric emptying and abdominal cramps.

It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of adults and children over 12 years of age with major depressive disorder and generalized anxiety disorder. Escitalopram is the (S)-stereoisomer of the earlier Lundbeck drug citalopram, hence the name escitalopram. Escitalopram is noted for its high selectivity with serotonin reuptake inhibition. The similarity between escitalopram and citalopram has led to accusations of ""evergreening"", an accusation that Lundbeck has rejected."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Etonogestrel	Etonogestrel	21729469	DB00294	304GTH6RNH	54048-10-1		Subdermal as slow-release implant	Hepatic	Etonogestrel is a steroidal progestin used in hormonal contraceptives, most notably the subdermal implant Nexplanon and the vaginal ring NuvaRing. Etonogestrel is the active metabolite of the inactive prodrug desogestrel, one of two third-generation progestins found in some epidemiological studies of combined oral contraceptive pills to be associated with a higher risk of venous thrombosis than combined oral contraceptive pills containing certain second-generation progestins. Because hormones are released continuously from NuvaRing, peak and total estrogen and progestin doses are significantly lower than with combined oral contraceptives, although it is not known whether this lowers the risk of blood clots.

Its primary action is to suppress the activity of the androgen hormones such as testosterone and its more potent metabolite dihydrotestosterone (DHT) in the body, effects which it mediates via competitive antagonism of the androgen receptor and inhibition of enzymes in the androgen biosynthesis pathway. The main therapeutic indications of cyproterone acetate are prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, priapism, hypersexuality (e.g. , as a form of chemical castration), and other conditions in which androgen action maintains the disease process. In addition, it can also be used to treat acne and hirsutism in females, and is a common component in hormone therapy for male-to-female transsexuals. In addition to its antiandrogen properties, cyproterone acetate has weak progestogen activity (i.e. , it acts like progesterone). Accordingly, it can be used to treat hot flashes, and is also a component of some combined oral contraceptive pills such as Dianette in the United Kingdom and Diane-35 in other countries such as Canada. No form of cyproterone acetate is available in the United States. Until the development of leuprolide, cyproterone acetate was one of the few drugs used to treat precocious puberty. It was also used in animal experimentation to investigate the actions of androgens in fetal sexual differentiation.

It is in the protease inhibitor class. Prezista is an OARAC recommended treatment option for treatment-naÃ¯ve and treatment-experienced adults and adolescents. Developed by pharmaceutical company Tibotec, darunavir is named after Arun K. Ghosh, the chemist who discovered the molecule at the University of Illinois at Chicago. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on June 23, 2006. Darunavir is a second-generation protease inhibitor (PIs), designed specifically to overcome problems with the older agents in this class, such as indinavir. Early PIs often have severe side effects and drug toxicities, require a high therapeutic dose, are costly to manufacture, and show a disturbing susceptibility to drug resistant mutations. Such mutations can develop in as little as a year of use, and effectively render the drugs useless. Darunavir was designed to form robust interactions with the protease enzyme from many strains of HIV, including strains from treatment-experienced patients with multiple resistance mutations to PIs. Darunavir received much attention at the time of its release, as it represents an important treatment option for patients with drug-resistant HIV. Patient advocacy groups pressured developer Tibotec not to follow the previous trend of releasing new drugs at prices higher than existing drugs in the same class. Darunavir was priced to match other common PIs already in use, such as the fixed-dose combination drug lopinavir/ritonavir.

It relieves itching, redness, dryness, crusting, scaling, inflammation, and discomfort. The usual prescription concentration is 0.05% as a topical cream, ointment, or gel. The application area should normally not be covered after application. In certain cases, the physician may recommend the use of an occlusive dressing after application to increase the rate and depth of absorption. The frequency of application depends on the condition being treated and the area affected, but most often it should be applied twice a day. Fluocinonide ranks as a ""high-potency"" (second-highest rank) topical corticosteroid. Minimal amounts should be used for a minimal length of time to avoid the occurrence of adverse effects. Fluocinonide should not be used if infection is present. It should not be applied to the eyes or to sensitive areas such as the genitals or anus. A common potential adverse effect is skin atrophy (thinning of the skin). Systemic absorption of topical corticosteroids can produce reversible hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (HPA) suppression, manifestations of Cushing's syndrome, hyperglycemia, and glucosuria in some patients. Fluocinonide should be used with caution when treating children, pregnant women, nursing mothers, and anyone using the medication for longer than two weeks. Fluocinonide is used in veterinary medicine. It is a treatment for allergies in dogs. Natural systemic cortisol concentrations can be suppressed for weeks after one week of topical exposure."

Early development was solely by Bristol-Myers Squibb; in 2007 AstraZeneca joined with Bristol-Myers Squibb to co-develop the final compound and collaborate on the marketing of the drug. A New Drug Application for saxagliptin in the treatment of type 2 diabetes was submitted to the FDA in June 2008. It was based on a drug development program with 8 randomized trials: 1 phase 2 dose-ranging (2.5â€“100Â mg/d) study; 6 phase 3, 24-week controlled trials with additional controlled follow-up from 12 to 42 months, double-blinded throughout; and one 12-week mechanism-of-action trial with a 2-year follow-up period. In June 2008, it was announced that Onglyza would be the trade name under which saxagliptin will be marketed. The FDA approved Saxagliptin with brand name Onglyza on July 31, 2009. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4's role in blood glucose regulation is thought to be through degradation of GIP and the degradation of GLP-1. Bristol-Myers Squibb announced on 27 December 2006 that Otsuka Pharmaceutical Co. has been granted exclusive rights to develop and commercialize the compound in Japan. Under the licensing agreement, Otsuka will be responsible for all development costs, but Bristol-Myers Squibb retains rights to co-promote saxagliptin with Otsuka in Japan. Further, on 11 January 2007 it was announced that Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca would work together to complete development of the drug and in subsequent marketing.

Related indications for clinical use include Quincke's edema, allergic reactions to insect bites, food and drug allergies, and anaphylactic shock. Chloropyramine is known as a competitive reversible H1-receptor antagonist (also known as an H1 inverse agonist), meaning that it exerts its pharmacological action by competing with histamine for the H1 subtype histamine receptor. By blocking the effects of histamine, the drug inhibits the vasodilation, increased vascular permeability, and tissue edema associated with histamine release in the tissue. The H1-antagonistic properties of chloropyramine can be used by researchers for the purposes of blocking the effects of histamine on cells and tissues. In addition, chloropyramine has some anticholinergic properties. Chloropyramine's anticholinergic properties and the fact that it can pass through the bloodâ€“brain barrier are linked to its clinical side effects: drowsiness, weakness, vertigo, fatigue, dryness in the mouth, constipation, and rarely - visual disturbances and increase of intraocular pressure."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quinbolone	Quinbolone	10360683		W59598KWLX	2487-63-0		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth	hepatic	Quinbolone (Anabolicum Vister) is an anabolic steroid with weak androgenic effects. It was developed by Parke-Davis in an attempt to create a viable orally-administered anabolic steroid with little or no liver toxicity. The drug is atypical in that steroid molecules are usually only given officially distinct names when there is a permanent structural difference between the parent molecule and itself. Quinbolone, however, differs from its parent molecule solely by the addition of an easily removed cyclopentenyl ether group. Most orally administered anabolic steroids function by having an alkylated 17Î±-carbon atom, which prevents first-pass metabolism by the liver. This approach does, however, give the drug a high hepatotoxicity. Quinbolone is not 17Î±-alkylated; instead it has increased oral bioavailability due to its cyclopentenyl ether group. This allows the drug to be fully dissolved in an oil base, which is then absorbed into the lymphatic system via the large intestine, from which it travels into the blood. Once there the ester group detaches and the relatively inactive quinbolone becomes boldenone, which then reacts with the androgen receptor of any muscles it comes into contact with. Quinbolone itself has very few androgenic effects, and most of what it does have are a result of its conversion to boldenone and its metabolites. This, combined with its unusual route of absorption, provides the drug with highly variable results, meaning that large quantities of the drug (100-200 mg per day) must be taken in order to maintain high enough concentrations in the blood for noticeable and consistent effects. The cost and inconvenience of this meant that quinbolone never proved commercially successful, and its clinical applications were fulfilled by alternative, more effective, steroids. Its illicit usage in bodybuilding and athletics likewise proved limited, though drug tests are still used to detect its metabolites as it remains a banned substance for most competitive sports.

It acts as a selective and potent 5-HT1A receptor partial agonist, readily stimulating prolactin responses, though it has also been found to bind to and activate the Ïƒ receptor. Naluzotan was well tolerated in clinical trials, with more patients in the control group dropping out due to adverse effects than in the active group in one study. The most frequently reported side effect was headache in 15% of patients (compared to 10% for placebo). In addition, naluzotan demonstrated significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects as per the HAM-D and MADRS and the HAM-A, respectively, in some trials, but in others it did not. In the end it was not found to be significantly superior enough to placebo and development was stopped.

Trastuzumab alone stops growth of cancer cells by binding to the HER2/neu receptor, whereas mertansine enters cells and destroys them by binding to tubulin. Because the monoclonal antibody targets HER2, and HER2 is only over-expressed in cancer cells, the conjugate delivers the toxin specifically to tumor cells. In the EMILIA clinical trial of women with advanced HER2 positive breast cancer who were already resistant to trastuzumab alone, it improved survival by 5.8 months compared to the combination of lapatinib and capecitabine. Based on that trial, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved marketing on February 22, 2013. Trastuzumab emtansine was developed by Genentech. The planned cost is expected to be $9,800 a month, or $94,000 for a typical course of treatment.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted the agent an accelerated approval on August 19, 2011 for use against these two diseases. It is marketed as Adcetris. The compound consists of the chimeric monoclonal antibody brentuximab (which targets the cell-membrane protein CD30) linked to three to five units of the antimitotic agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE, reflected by the 'vedotin' in the drug's name). The antibody portion of the drug attaches to CD30 on the surface of malignant cells, delivering MMAE which is responsible for the anti-tumour activity. Hence it is an antibody-drug conjugate. In a 2010 clinical trial, 34% of patients with refractory Hodgkin Lymphoma achieved complete remission and another 40% had partial remission. Tumor reductions were achieved in 94% of patients. In ALCL, 87% of patients had tumors shrink at least 50% and 97% of patients had some tumor shrinkage. On 28 February 2011 a Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the use of brentuximab vedotin in relapsed or refractory Hodgkin's lymphoma and relapsed or refractory systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methastyridone	Methastyridone			C1846N9AVW	721-19-7				Methastyridone is a centrally-acting stimulant, whose mode of action differs from that of classical agents such as d-amphetamine. About MK-202, the following is noted: Merckâ€™s behavioral psychopharmacology screening program finally identified one highly promising new antidepressant. Code named MK-202, the chemical increased lever-pressing work output under a range of conditions, in seemingly more adaptive ways than amphetamine. For instance, in the â€œstrained fixed-ratioâ€ﾝ test, designed to measure â€œan animalâ€™s ability to handle an overly large workload with inadequate motivation,â€ﾝ MK-202 performed better than dextroamphetamine. Here, hungry rats were given a drop of condensed milk only after pressing a lever two hundred times in response to a light signal. However, in the middle of their heavy and under-rewarded task a second light would turn on intermittently, and if they immediately responded by pressing a second lever they would get a milk drop instantly. Thus, this experiment measured both willingness to do â€œa particularly long and tedious jobâ€ﾝ as well as â€œalertnessâ€ﾝ to a second stimulus, according to Merck researchers. The rats on amphetamine performed well on the repetitive task but tended to miss the second stimulus; not so the rats on MK-202. Given the similarity between the ratâ€™s situation and the repetitive work that most people must endure to make a living, a drug that increased lever pressing without producing unresponsiveness would seem a likely antidepressantâ€”provided we accept that inefficiency in unrewarding jobs indicates psychiatric depression. This implicit identification of impaired work efficiency with depressive illness, inscribed in the use of amphetamine-boosted lever pressing as the benchmark that subsequent antidepressants had to meet, applied to the highest level executive type of work also. (The business world is called a â€œrat raceâ€ﾝ with reason!) This is evident from another test, designed to measure a ratâ€™s capacity to perform complex tasks. Here, to get a reward, rats had to press a lever rapidly when a white light was on, slowly when a red light was on, and not at all when both lights were on. The rats on amphetamine pressed their levers fast no matter what lights were on, but the rats on MK-202 only pressed fast when high speed was rewarded. In these and a half a dozen other experiments with trained rats subject to diabolically ingenious â€œreinforcement schedulesâ€ﾝ (that is, particular programs of reward and punishment), MK-202 outperformed amphetamine for boosting work output, maximizing reward, and minimizing punishment, particularly when tasks were both difficult and unrewarding. A more promising antidepressant drug candidate could hardly be imagined, and in January 1960 the behavioral psychopharmacology unit passed it on for human testing as an antidepressant, with its highest recommendation.9 Thus, it would appear that MK-202 has properties that make it more suitable as an antidepressant than amphetamine, even though amphetamine was a very popular choice of antidepressant and the time that the above quote was taken.

The resulting water uptake leads to cell death. Polymyxins are cationic, basic proteins that act like detergents. Side effects include neurotoxicity and acute renal tubular necrosis. Polymyxins are used in the topical first-aid preparation Neosporin. Family of polypeptides with attached fatty acid; cationic detergent at physiological pH, both hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties Bactericidal for gram-negative; little to no effect on gram-positive, since cell wall is too thick to permit access to membrane

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metkefamide	Metkefamide	5464184			66960-34-7			http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Metkefamide, or metkephamid acetate, but most frequently referred to simply as metkephamid, is a synthetic opioid pentapeptide and derivative of Met Met]enkephalin with the amino acid sequence Tyr--Ala-Gly-Phe-(N-Me)-Met-NH2. It behaves as a potent agonist of the Î´- and Î¼-opioid receptors with roughly equipotent affinity, and also has similarly high affinity as well as subtype-selectivity for the Îº3-opioid receptor. Despite its peptidic nature, upon systemic administration, metkefamide rapidly penetrates the blood-brain-barrier and disperses into the central nervous system where it produces potent, centrally-mediated analgesic effects, of which have been shown to be dependent on activity at both the Î¼- and Î´-opioid receptors. In addition, on account of modifications to the N- and C-terminals, metkefamide is highly stable against proteolytic degradation relative to many other opioid peptides. As an example, while its parent peptide, [Met Met]enkephalin, has an in vivo half-life of merely seconds, metkefamide has a half-life of nearly 60 minutes, and upon intramuscular administration, has been shown to provide pain relief that lasts for hours. Likely on account of its Î´-opioid activity, clinical trials have found metkefamide to possess less of a tendency for producing many of the undesirable side effects usually associated with conventional opioids such as respiratory depression, tolerance, and physical dependence. However, it has been shown to cause some additional side effects that are considered unusual for standard opioid analgesics like sensations of heaviness in the extremities and nasal congestionâ€”though these were not considered to be particularly distressingâ€”and it has also been shown to raise the seizure threshold in animals. In any case, clinical development was not further pursued after phase I clinical studies and metkefamide never reached the pharmaceutical market.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Benzylpiperidine	2-Benzylpiperidine	118004			32838-55-4		Oral		2-Benzylpiperidine is a stimulant drug of the piperidine class. It is similar in structure to other drugs such as methylphenidate and desoxypipradrol but around 20 times less potent, and while it boosts norepinephrine levels to around the same extent as d-amphetamine, it has very little effect on dopamine levels, with its binding affinity for the dopamine transporter around 175 times lower than for the noradrenaline transporter. 2-benzylpiperidine is little used as a stimulant, with its main use being as a synthetic intermediate in the manufacture of other drugs.

It has been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and likely induces their release as well. It is also likely to act on dopamine on account of its full substitution of d-amphetamine in rodent studies.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Desmethylclozapine	Desmethylclozapine	2820			6104-71-8		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		N-Desmethylclozapine (NDMC), or norclozapine, is a major active metabolite of the atypical antipsychotic drug clozapine. Unlike clozapine, it possesses intrinsic activity at the D2/D3 receptors, and acts as a weak partial agonist at these sites similarly to aripiprazole and bifeprunox. Notably, NDMC has also been shown to act as a potent and efficacious agonist at the M1 and Î´-opioid receptors, unlike clozapine as well. Therefore, NDMC is considered a delta-opioid agonist. It was hypothesized that on account of these unique actions, NDMC might underlie the clinical superiority of clozapine over other antipsychotics. However, clinical trials found NMDC itself ineffective in the treatment of schizophrenia. This may be because it possesses relatively low D2/D3 occupancy compared to 5-HT2 (<15% versus 64-79% at a dose of 10â€“60Â mg/kg s.c. in animal studies). In any case, though not useful in the treatment of positive symptoms on its own, it cannot be ruled out that NDMC may contribute to the improvement of cognitive and/or negative symptoms with clozapine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lophophine	Lophophine	90239			23693-38-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		Lophophine (3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyphenethylamine) is a putative psychedelic and entactogen drug of the phenethylamine class. It is the Î±-demethylated homologue of MMDA, and is also closely related to mescaline. Alexander Shulgin originally suggested that lophophine may be a natural constituent of peyote (Lophophora williamsii) due to it being the only logical chemical intermediate for the biosynthesis of several tetrahydroisoquinolines known to be present in this cactus species. Subsequently, lophophine was indeed shown to be a minor component of both peyote and San Pedro cactus. Shulgin reports that lophophine is active in the dosage range of 150-250Â mg. He states that at these doses, lophophine has some similarity to mescaline in action, in producing a peaceful elevation of mood, euphoria, and mild enhancement of visual perception, but without the generation of closed-eye mental imagery. Shulgin also notes that (in contrast to mescaline), lophophine causes no nausea. At dosages above 300Â mg, visual distortions that resemble those of standard doses of mescaline are said to begin to appear.

Nabiximols is distinct from all other pharmaceutically produced cannabinoids currently available because it is derived from cannabis plants, rather than a solely synthetic process. The drug is a pharmaceutical product standardised in composition, formulation, and dose, although it is still effectively a tincture of the cannabis plant. Its principal active cannabinoid components are the cannabinoids: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD). The product is formulated as an oromucosal spray which is administered by spraying into the mouth. Each spray delivers a near 1:1 ratio of CBD to THC, with a fixed dose of 2.7Â mg THC and 2.5Â mg CBD. Nabiximols is also being developed in Phase III trials as a potential treatment to alleviate pain due to cancer.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/RTI-150	RTI-150	9972881			752958-88-6				RTI-150, (-2Î²-Carbocyclobutoxy-3Î²-tropane) is a phenyltropane derivative which acts as a potent dopamine reuptake inhibitor and stimulant drug. It is around 5x more potent than cocaine, but is more selective for the dopamine transporter relative to the other monoamine transporters. RTI-150 has a fast onset of effects and short duration of action, and its abuse potential in animal studies is similar to that of cocaine itself; its main application in scientific research has been in studies investigating the influence of pharmacokinetics on the abuse potential of stimulant drugs, with the rapid entry of RTI-150 into the brain thought to be a key factor in producing its high propensity for development of dependence in animals. RTI-150 is not explicitly illegal anywhere in the world, but its similar structure and pharmacological activity to cocaine makes it possible that it would be considered a controlled substance analogue in countries such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand which have controlled substance analogue legislation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/EA-3443	EA-3443	37838			37830-21-0				"EA-3443 is a potent and long lasting anticholinergic deliriant drug, related to the chemical warfare agent 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, during research to improve upon the properties of earlier agents such as QNB. The main advantages of EA-3443 were not only increased potency over QNB, but also a significantly improved central to peripheral effects ratio. Anticholinergic drugs produce both incapacitating deliriant effects through action in the brain, and a variety of distinctive physical symptoms such as dry mouth, dilated pupils, blurred vision and hot flushed skin, all of which together comprise the ""anticholinergic syndrome"" which is generally easy for doctors to diagnose. EA-3443 however is mainly selective for the brain, and when administered in a narrow dose range of around 0.3mg can produce the central effects of confusion, hallucinations and amnesia, but without producing significant physical symptoms, which was predicted to make poisoning with EA-3443 much more difficult to diagnose and treat. However despite these advantages, EA-3443 was never researched to the same extent as QNB or manufactured in bulk, and research into EA-3443 was discontinued along with the rest of the US chemical weapons program in the mid-1970s."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxymorphazone	Oxymorphazone	9577748			73697-35-5				Oxymorphazone is an opioid analgesic drug related to oxymorphone. Oxymorphazone is a potent and long acting Î¼-opioid agonist which binds irreversibly to the receptor, forming a covalent bond which prevents it from detaching once bound. This gives it an unusual pharmacological profile, and while oxymorphazone is only around half the potency of oxymorphone, with higher doses the analgesic effect becomes extremely long lasting, with a duration of up to 48 hours. However, tolerance to analgesia develops rapidly with repeated doses, as chronically activated opioid receptors are rapidly internalised by Î²-arrestins, similar to the results of non-covalent binding by agonists with extremely high binding affinity such as lofentanil.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine	2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine	1295			119237-64-8				2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine (Desoxy-D2PM), also known as 2-benzhydrylpyrrolidine, is a stimulant psychoactive drug. It is the 4-dehydroxylated structural analogue of diphenylprolinol (D2PM), and is also similar in structure to desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP), both of which act as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). Like D2PM and 2-DPMP, Desoxy-D2PM is sold as a designer drug, and has been used in the manufacture of legal highs. It has been marketed under the names A3A New Generation, A3A Methano, and Green Powder, and has been reported to cause hallucinations, violent behavior, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and high blood pressure. Literature data suggest a high risk of central nervous and cardiovascular system toxicity. Desoxy-D2PM has two enantiomers which are used industrially in their purified form as chiral derivatizing agents during chemical synthesis. As of the 4th November 2010, the UK Home Office announced a ban on the importation of 2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine, following a recommendation from the ACMD. It was due to become a class B drug on the 28th March 2012, but the bill was scrapped, due to the presence of two steroids included in the bill that were later recommended to remain uncontrolled.

JTC-801 is a selective antagonist for the nociceptin receptor, also known as the ORL-1 receptor. This was the fourth opioid receptor to be discovered, and is still the least understood. The noiciceptin receptor has complex effects which are involved in many processes to do with pain and inflammation, and activation of this receptor can either increase or reduce pain depending on dose. Drugs acting at the noiciceptin receptor may influence the effects of traditional analgesics including prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors such as NSAIDs, Î¼-opioid agonist drugs, and cannabinoids. JTC-801 is an orally active drug that blocks the nociceptin receptor and produces analgesic effects in a variety of animal studies, and is particularly useful for neuropathic pain and allodynia associated with nerve injury.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abnormal_cannabidiol	Abnormal cannabidiol	3060519			78216-32-7				"Abnormal cannabidiol (abn-cbd) is a synthetic regioisomer of cannabidiol, which unlike most other cannabinoids produces vasodilator effects, lowers blood pressure, and induces cell migration, cell proliferation and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation in microglia, but without producing any psychoactive effects. It has been shown that the actions of abnormal cannabidiol are mediated through a site separate from the CB1 and CB2 receptors, which responds to abnormal cannabidiol, O-1602, and the endogenous ligands: anandamide (AEA), N-arachidonoyl glycine (NAGly) and N-arachidonoyl L-serine. Multiple lines of evidence support the proposed identification of this novel target in microglia as the previously ""orphan"" receptor GPR18. Another possible target of abnormal cannabidiol is GPR55, which has also received much attention as a putative cannabinoid receptor, although a growing body of evidence points to lysophosphatidylinositol (LPI) as the endogenous ligand for GPR55. Further research suggests there are yet more additional cannabinoid receptors."

Studies in vitro suggest that it binds to a regulatory site on the CB1 receptor target, causing a conformational change that increases the binding affinity of CB1 agonists such as CP 55,940, while decreasing the binding affinity of CB1 antagonists or inverse agonists such as rimonabant. However while Org 27569 increases the ability of CB1 agonists to bind to the receptor, it decreases their efficacy at stimulating second messenger signalling once bound, and so in practice behaves as an insurmountable antagonist of CB1 receptor function.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Fluoroamphetamine	2-Fluoroamphetamine	121531			1716-60-5				2-Fluoroamphetamine (2-FA) is a stimulant drug from the amphetamine family which has rarely been sold as a designer drug. In addition, both 2-fluorophenethylamine and amphetamine have been found to act as potent agonists at the trace amine-associated receptor TAAR1, making it likely that 2-fluoroamphetamine also has significant activity at this receptor. 2-fluoroamphetamine differs from 3- and 4-fluoroamphetamine in the position of the fluorine atom on the aromatic ring, making them structural isomers to one another. The replacement of a hydrogen atom with a fluorine atom in certain compounds to facilitate passage through the bloodâ€“brain barrier, as is desirable in central nervous system pharmaceutical agents, is a common practice due to the corresponding increase in lipophilicity granted by the substitute.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dibutyltryptamine	Dibutyltryptamine	27848			15741-77-2				"Dibutyltryptamine (DBT) is a psychedelic drug belonging to the tryptamine family. It is found either as its crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base. DBT was first synthesized by the chemist Alexander Shulgin and reported in his book TiHKAL (Tryptamines i Have Known And Loved). Shulgin did not test DBT himself, but reports a human dosage of ""1 mg/kg i.m. "" being active, but less so than DMT or DET. This suggests that an active dosage of DBT will be in the 100Â mg range. This compound has been sold as a ""research chemical"" and has been confirmed to be an active hallucinogen although somewhat weaker than other similar tryptamine derivatives. There are four symmetrical isomers of DBT which can be made, or ten isomers in total if unsymmetrical substitution is used. Of these only the n-butyl analogue DBT is known to be active in humans; the isobutyl, sec-butyl, and tert-butyl isomers DIBT, DSBT and DTBT have never been tested and only DBT and DIBT were made by Shulgin. The unsymmetrical isomers BIBT, BSBT, BTBT, IBSBT, IBTBT and SBTBT are also possible but have never been made and no predictions have been made about their activity. Shulgin speculates that the s-butyl isomer DSBT may be more potent than the straight chain compound DBT, but that the more highly branched DIBT and DTBT would probably be inactive due to the bulk of the substituent group. As for longer chain compounds than butyl, they have not been made and would probably be inactive. Shulgin mentions that the monohexyl compound NHT is without activity. However the unsymmetrical compounds such as methylbutyltryptamine show more promise, and a wide range of possible compounds could be made by pairing the various butyl isomers with methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl or allyl groups."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iodine-123	Iodine-123	135300			69239-56-1				Iodine-123 (I or I-123) is a radioactive isotope of iodine used in nuclear medicine imaging, including single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). The isotope's half-life is 13.22 hours; the decay by electron capture to tellurium-123 emits gamma radiation with a predominant energy of 159 keV (this is the gamma primarily used for imaging). In medical applications, the radiation is detected by a gamma camera. The isotope is typically applied as iodide-123, the anionic form.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metenolone_enanthate	Metenolone enanthate	248271			303-42-4				"Metenolone enanthate (or methenolone enanthate) is a dihydrotestosterone (DHT) based anabolic steroid. It is an ester derivative of methenolone sold commonly under the brand names Primobolan or Primobolan Depot. When it interacts with the aromatase enzyme it does not form any estrogens. It is used by people who are very susceptible to estrogenic side effects, having lower estrogenic properties than nandrolone. Methenolone, in form of enanthate and acetate, is available as an injection or as an oral respectively. The injection is naturally regarded as having a higher bioavailability. It is an enanthate ester which is quite long-acting. Because it by-passes hepatic breakdown on the first pass, it also has a higher survival rate. The tablets are in a short-lived acetate form. Methenolone is not 17-alpha-alkylated, but 1-methylated for oral bioavailability. This reduces the stress on the liver, but also the availability. It is considered one of the safer steroids, meaning it has few side effects. Methenolone has no estrogenic side effects, and its effects on cholesterol levels are minimal. In doses of 200 mg per week or less blood pressure is rarely altered. It is possibly one of the safer anabolic steroids for females due to very low virilization effects in short-term usage. Methenolone is also not overly suppressive of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis, although how suppressive is debatable. For this reason, many bodybuilders use it in between steroid cycles during their ""off-time"" to help maintain their gains and strength. The long term safety of such a practice is possibly dangerous and can lead to permanent suppression of the HPTA."

The precise mechanism of action through which these effects are exerted remains unclear as of 2010, but the pharmacological effects of P7C3 in vitro resemble those of endogenous proneurogenic peptides such as fibroblast growth factor 1, and the proneurogenic activity of P7C3 was around thirty times that of dimebon when they were compared side by side. P7C3 was chosen for further animal studies on the basis of favourable pharmacokinetic factors, such as its high oral bioavailability and long duration of action, but several other related compounds showed similar activity such as the more potent fluorinated analogue P7C3A20 which is up to ten times stronger again, and the methoxy analogue P7C3-OMe, for which it was determined that the (R) enantiomer is the active form.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/PF-2545920	PF-2545920	11581936							PF-2545920 is a drug developed by Pfizer for the treatment of schizophrenia. It acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor selective for the PDE10A subtype. The PDE10A enzyme is expressed primarily in the brain, mostly in the striatum, nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle, and is thought to be particularly important in regulating the activity of dopamine-sensitive medium spiny neurons in the striatum which are known to be targets of conventional antipsychotic drugs. Older PDE10A inhibitors such as papaverine have been shown to produce antipsychotic effects in animal models, and more potent and selective PDE10A inhibitors are a current area of research for novel antipsychotic drugs which act through a different pathway to conventional dopamine or 5HT2A antagonist drugs and may have a more favourable side effects profile. PF-2545920 is currently one of the furthest advanced PDE10A inhibitors in development and has progressed through to Phase II clinical trials in humans.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hepatitis_B_vaccine	Hepatitis B vaccine								Hepatitis B vaccine is a vaccine developed for the prevention of hepatitis B virus infection. The vaccine contains one of the viral envelope proteins, hepatitis B surface antigen. It is produced by yeast cells, into which the genetic code for HBsAg has been inserted. A course of two to three (2-3) vaccine injections are given, the second injection at least one month after the first dose and the third injection being administered six months after the first dose. The first and second dose offer complete protection. The final injection (second or third depending on number of vaccines being administered) is to prolong protection against the hepatitis B virus. Afterward an immune system antibody to HBsAg is established in the bloodstream. The antibody is known as anti-HBsAg. This antibody and immune system memory then provide immunity to hepatitis B infection. The first vaccine became available in 1981. A range of vaccines is available in the market. Presently recombinant DNA vaccines are available, which means they are produced by inserting the gene for HBV into common baker's yeast where it is grown, harvested, and purified. HBV infection cannot occur from receiving hepatitis B vaccine. The common brands available are Recombixax HB (Merck), Engerix-B (GSK), Elovac B (Human Biologicals Institute, a division of Indian Immunologicals Limited), Genevac B (Serum Institute), Shanvac B, etc. These vaccines are given intramuscularly.

Pheniramine is also commonly found in eyedrops used for the treatment of allergic conjunctivitis. Pheniramine is generally sold in combination with other medications, rather than as a stand-alone drug, although some formulations are available containing pheniramine by itself. As an example, Neo Citran contains pheniramine.

It works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins, molecules known to cause these symptoms. It is marketed under more than seventy different trade names.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ketamine	Ketamine	3821	DB01221	690G0D6V8H	6740-88-1		IV, IM, Insufflated, oral, topical	Hepatic, primarily by CYP3A4	"Ketamine is a drug used in human and veterinary medicine, primarily for the induction and maintenance of general anesthesia, usually in combination with a sedative. Other uses include sedation in intensive care, analgesia (particularly in emergency medicine), and treatment of bronchospasm. Ketamine has a wide range of effects in humans, including analgesia, anesthesia, hallucinations, elevated blood pressure, and bronchodilation. Like other drugs of its class such as tiletamine and phencyclidine (PCP), it induces a state referred to as ""dissociative anesthesia"" and is used as a recreational drug. Ketamine has been shown to be effective in treating depression in patients with bipolar disorder who have not responded to antidepressants. In persons with major depressive disorder, it produces a rapid antidepressant effect, acting within two hours as opposed to the several weeks taken by typical antidepressants to work. Its hydrochloride salt is sold as Ketanest, Ketaset, and Ketalar. Pharmacologically, ketamine is classified as an NMDA receptor antagonist. At high, fully anesthetic level doses, ketamine has also been found to bind to Î¼-opioid receptors type 2 in cultured human neuroblastoma cellsÂ â€“ however, without agonist activityÂ â€“ and to sigma receptors in rats. Also, ketamine interacts with muscarinic receptors, descending monoaminergic pain pathways and voltage-gated calcium channels. Ketamine is a chiral compound. Most pharmaceutical preparations of ketamine are racemic; however, some brands reportedly have (mostly undocumented) differences in enantiomeric proportions. The more active enantiomer, (S)-ketamine, is also available for medical use under the brand name Ketanest S. Ketamine is a 'core' medicine in the World Health Organization's ""Essential Drugs List"", a list of minimum medical needs for a basic healthcare system."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Losartan	Losartan	3961	DB00678	JMS50MPO89	114798-26-4		Oral	Hepatic	Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor antagonist drug used mainly to treat high blood pressure. Losartan was the first angiotensin II receptor antagonist to be marketed. Losartan potassium is marketed by Merck & Co. Inc. under the trade name Cozaar. As of 2009, In south east Asia Losartan potassium is marketed by Delta Pharma Ltd. under the trade name Anin. losartan is available in generic form. As with all angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1) antagonists, losartan is indicated for the treatment of hypertension. It may also delay progression of diabetic nephropathy, and is also indicated for the reduction of renal disease progression in patients with type 2 diabetes, hypertension and microalbuminuria (>30Â mg/24 hours) or proteinuria (>900Â mg/24 hours). Although clinical evidence shows calcium channel blockers and thiazide-type diuretics are preferred first-line treatments for most patients (from both efficacy and cost points of view), an angiotensin II receptor antagonist such as losartan is recommended as first-line treatment in patients under the age of 55 who cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor. The LIFE study demonstrated losartan was significantly superior to atenolol in the primary prevention of adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction or stroke), with a significant reduction in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality for a comparable reduction in blood pressure. A study hints that losartan has a beneficial effect on mitochondria by reversing age related dysfunction in maintaining normal blood pressure and cellular energy usage. The maximal effects on blood pressure usually occur within 3-6 weeks upon starting losartan. Losartan is also available as hydrochlorothiazide/losartan, a combination drug with a low dose thiazide diuretic to achieve an additive antihypertensive effect.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mefenamic_acid	Mefenamic acid	4044	DB00784	367589PJ2C	61-68-7		Oral	Hepatic	Mefenamic acid is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug used to treat pain, including menstrual pain. It is typically prescribed for oral administration. Mefenamic acid is marketed in the USA as Ponstel and is commonly known in UK as Ponstan. Mefenamic acid decreases inflammation (swelling) and uterine contractions by a still unknown mechanism. However it is thought to be related to the inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis. There is also evidence that supports the use of mefenamic acid for perimenstrual migraine headache prophylaxis, with treatment starting 2 days prior to the onset of flow or 1 day prior to the expected onset of the headache and continuing for the duration of menstruation. Since hepatic metabolism plays a significant role in mefenamic acid elimination, patients with known liver deficiency may be prescribed lower doses. Kidney deficiency may also cause accumulation of the drug and its metabolites in the excretory system. Therefore patients suffering from renal conditions should not be prescribed mefenamic acid.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Morphine	Morphine	5288826	DB00295	76I7G6D29C	57-27-2		Inhalation , insufflation , oral, rectal, subcutaneous , intramuscular , intravenous , and intrathecal	Hepatic 90%	Morphine is a potent opiate analgesic drug that is used to relieve severe pain. It was first isolated in 1804 by Friedrich SertÃ¼rner, first distributed by him in 1817, and first commercially sold by Merck in 1827, which at the time was a single small chemists' shop. It was more widely used after the invention of the hypodermic needle in 1857. It took its name from the Greek god of dreams Morpheus. Morphine is the most abundant opiate found in opium, the dried latex extracted by shallowly slicing the unripe seedpods of the Papaver somniferum poppy. Morphine was the first active principle purified from a plant source and is one of at least 50 alkaloids of several different types present in opium, poppy straw concentrate, and other poppy derivatives. Morphine is generally 8 to 14 percent of the dry weight of opium, although specially bred cultivars reach 26 percent or produce little morphine at all (under 1 percent, perhaps down to 0.04 percent). The latter varieties, including the 'Przemko' and 'Norman' cultivars of the opium poppy, are used to produce two other alkaloids, thebaine and oripavine, which are used in the manufacture of semi-synthetic and synthetic opioids like oxycodone and etorphine and some other types of drugs. P. bracteatum does not contain morphine or codeine, or other narcotic phenanthrene-type, alkaloids. This species is rather a source of thebaine. Occurrence of morphine in other Papaverales and Papaveraceae, as well as in some species of hops and mulberry trees has not been confirmed. Morphine is produced most predominantly early in the life cycle of the plant. Past the optimum point for extraction, various processes in the plant produce codeine, thebaine, and in some cases negligible amounts of hydromorphone, dihydromorphine, dihydrocodeine, tetrahydro-thebaine, and hydrocodone (these compounds are rather synthesized from thebaine and oripavine). The human body produces endorphins, which are endogenous opioid peptides that function as neurotransmitters and have similar effects. In clinical medicine, morphine is regarded as the gold standard, or benchmark, of opioid analgesics used to relieve severe or agonizing pain and suffering. Like other opioids, such as oxycodone, hydromorphone, and diacetylmorphine, morphine acts directly on the central nervous system (CNS) to relieve pain. Morphine has a high potential for addiction; tolerance and psychological dependence develop rapidly, although physiological dependence may take several months to develop.

It acts as a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. It is made in the roots and accumulates in the leaves of the plants. It constitutes approximately 0.6â€“3.0% of the dry weight of tobacco and is present in the range of 2â€“7Â Âµg/kg of various edible plants. It functions as an antiherbivore chemical; therefore, nicotine was widely used as an insecticide in the past and nicotine analogs such as imidacloprid are currently widely used. In smaller doses (an average cigarette yields about 1Â mg of absorbed nicotine), the substance acts as a stimulant in mammals, while high amounts (30â€“60Â mg) can be fatal. This stimulant effect is likely a major contributing factor to the dependence-forming properties of tobacco smoking. According to the American Heart Association, nicotine addiction has historically been one of the hardest addictions to break, while the pharmacological and behavioral characteristics that determine tobacco addiction are similar to those determining addiction to heroin and cocaine. The nicotine content of popular American-brand cigarettes has slowly increased over the years, and one study found that there was an average increase of 1.78% per year between the years of 1998 and 2005. This was found for all major market categories of cigarettes. Research in 2011 has found that nicotine inhibits chromatin-modifying enzymes (class I and II histone deacetylases) which increases the ability of cocaine to cause an addiction.

It is a bacteriostatic antibiotic, classified as a long-acting type. As a result of its long half-life it generally has serum levels 2â€“4 times that of the simple water-soluble tetracyclines (150Â mg giving 16 times the activity levels compared with 250Â mg of tetracycline at 24â€“48 hours). Minocycline is the most lipid-soluble of the tetracycline-class antibiotics, giving it the greatest penetration into the prostate and brain, but also the greatest amount of central nervous system (CNS)-related side effects, such as vertigo. A common side effect is diarrhea. Uncommon side effects (with prolonged therapy) include skin discolouration and autoimmune disorders that are not seen with other drugs in the class. Minocycline is a relatively poor tetracycline-class antibiotic choice for urinary pathogens sensitive to this antibiotic class, as its solubility in water and levels in the urine are less than all other tetracyclines. Minocycline is metabolized by the liver and has poor urinary excretion. Minocycline is not a naturally-occurring antibiotic, but was synthesized semi-synthetically from natural tetracycline antibiotics by Lederle Laboratories in 1972, and marketed by them under the brand name Minocin.

Drotaverine is a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 4, and has no anticholinergic effects. Drotaverine has been shown to possess dose-dependant analgesic effects in animal models. One small study has shown drotaverine to be eliminated mainly non-renally. A few small 2003 studies found drotaverine to be nearly 80% effective in treating renal colic. It has also been studied in accelerating labor by speeding up cervical dilation, but the results have been conflicting. Drotaverine has been shown to be effective in paracervical block in managing pain during hysteroscopy and endometrial biopsy when administered together with mefenamic acid. Irritable bowel syndrome patients presenting with predominant diarrhea are more likely to benefit from Buscopan. Drotaverin has also been tested in combination with rimantadine for antiviral activity against A and B type influenza. Drotaverin has an adverse effects frequency of 0.9%, side effects being relatively uncommon. Drotaverine is sold under brand name No-Spa (Chinoin Pharmaceutical and Chemical Works, Hungary, a member of the Sanofi-Aventis) and under many other names in the states of former Soviet Union (such as Kazakhstan), e.g. ÐﾝÐ¾-ÑˆÐ¿Ð° (No-shpa). It was concluded that drotaverine is highly effective in reducing the duration of active phase of labour by hastening cervical dilatation, more effective when given in more dilated cervix than with less dilatation and more effective in multigravida than in primigravida. There was no interference with uterine contractility and no increase in operative delivery. It reduces the incidence of traumatic postpartum haemorrhage by reducing the incidence of cervical tear. It is a safe drug for the mother as well as for the baby.

It is closely related to diphenhydramine. Therefore, it is related to other drugs used for Parkinson's like benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, and it is also structurally related to nefopam, which is a centrally-acting yet non-opioid analgesic. The combination of anticholinergic effects and CNS penetration make orphenadrine useful for pain of all etiologies, including pain from: radiculopathy, muscle pain, and headaches. Orphenadrine has approximately 58% of the anticholinergic potency of atropine at equivalent doses. Orphenadrine is most often used against pain and muscle spasm of various etiologies including lumbago, sciatica, and injury. It is quite useful against allergic symptoms and other histamine-related effects, such as those from hay fever, other allergies, and histamine release from many opioid analgesics. Where available for prescription compounding, orphenadrine can also be prepared for topical administration and works slightly better than diphenhydramine for this purpose. The orphenadrine salt used for Parkinsonism is the hydrochloride, whereas the muscle relaxant tablets are the citrate. The manufacturers' descriptions of orphenadrine indicate that the salts are not interchangeable; one reason may be that the citrate can be irritating when injected. Euphoria is an effect reported by many patients and orphenadrine has been investigated for use against depression, as first reported in June 1958 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Like many first-generation antihistamines and chemically-similar anticholinergics, orphenadrine can also cause excitement and insomnia, particularly in children and the elderly. Orphenadrine also works on smooth muscle in a manner identical to that of dicyclomine, brand name Bentyl, and will impact Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a similar fashion.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Orphenadrine	Orphenadrine	4601	DB01173	AL805O9OG9	83-98-7		Oral, intravenous, intramuscular	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Demethylation	Orphenadrine is an anticholinergic drug of the ethanolamine antihistamine class with prominent CNS and peripheral actions used to treat painful muscle spasms, other similar conditions, as well as the treatment of some aspects of Parkinson's Disease. It is closely related to diphenhydramine. Therefore, it is related to other drugs used for Parkinson's like benztropine and trihexyphenidyl, and it is also structurally related to nefopam, which is a centrally-acting yet non-opioid analgesic. The combination of anticholinergic effects and CNS penetration make orphenadrine useful for pain of all etiologies, including pain from: radiculopathy, muscle pain, and headaches. Orphenadrine has approximately 58% of the anticholinergic potency of atropine at equivalent doses. Orphenadrine is most often used against pain and muscle spasm of various etiologies including lumbago, sciatica, and injury. It is quite useful against allergic symptoms and other histamine-related effects, such as those from hay fever, other allergies, and histamine release from many opioid analgesics. Where available for prescription compounding, orphenadrine can also be prepared for topical administration and works slightly better than diphenhydramine for this purpose. The orphenadrine salt used for Parkinsonism is the hydrochloride, whereas the muscle relaxant tablets are the citrate. The manufacturers' descriptions of orphenadrine indicate that the salts are not interchangeable; one reason may be that the citrate can be irritating when injected. Euphoria is an effect reported by many patients and orphenadrine has been investigated for use against depression, as first reported in June 1958 in the American Journal of Psychiatry. Like many first-generation antihistamines and chemically-similar anticholinergics, orphenadrine can also cause excitement and insomnia, particularly in children and the elderly. Orphenadrine also works on smooth muscle in a manner identical to that of dicyclomine, brand name Bentyl, and will impact Irritable Bowel Syndrome in a similar fashion.

It is sold under various brand names with the most common being Noroxin. In form of ophthalmic solutions it is known as Chibroxin. Norfloxacin is a first generation synthetic fluoroquinolone (quinolone) developed by Kyorin Seiyaku K.K. (Kyorin). The licensed uses for norfloxacin are quite limited as norfloxacin is to be considered a drug of last resort when all other antibiotics have failed. There are currently only three approved uses in the adult population (one of which is restricted) and the other ineffective due to bacterial resistance. Chibroxin (ophthalmic) is approved for use in children older than one year of age. Norfloxacin interacts with a number of other drugs, as well as a number of herbal and natural supplements. Such interactions increase the risk of anticoagulation and the formation of non-absorbable complexes, as well as increasing the risk of toxicity. Norfloxacin is associated with a number of serious and life threatening adverse reactions as well as spontaneous tendon ruptures and irreversible peripheral neuropathy. Such reactions may manifest long after therapy had been completed and in severe cases may result in lifelong disabilities. Hepatoxicity resulting in fatalities has also been reported with the use of norfloxacin.

Clocortolone reduces the swelling, itching, and redness that can occur in these types of conditions. This medication is a medium-strength corticosteroid. How to use Cloderm Top: Use this medication on the skin only. However, do not use it on the face, groin, or underarms unless directed to do so by your doctor. Wash and dry your hands before using. Clean and dry the affected area. Apply a thin film of medication to the affected area and gently rub in, usually 3 times daily or as directed by your doctor. Do not bandage, cover, or wrap the area unless directed to do so by your doctor. If used in the diaper area on an infant, do not use tight-fitting diapers or plastic pants. After applying the medication, wash your hands unless you are using this medication to treat the hands. When applying this medication near the eyes, avoid getting it in the eyes because this may worsen or cause glaucoma. Also, avoid getting this medication in the nose or mouth. If you get the medication in these areas, rinse with plenty of water. Use this medication only for the condition for which it was prescribed. Do not use it for longer than prescribed. Inform your doctor if your condition persists or worsens after 2 weeks. Cloderm Top Side Effects: Stinging, burning, itching, irritation, dryness, or redness at the application site may occur when this medication is first applied to the skin. These effects should disappear in a few days as your body adjusts to the medication. If any of these effects persist or worsen, notify your doctor or pharmacist promptly. Remember that your doctor has prescribed this medication because he or she has judged that the benefit to you is greater than the risk of side effects. Many people using this medication do not have serious side effects. Tell your doctor immediately if any of these unlikely but serious side effects occur: stretch marks, skin thinning/discoloration, acne, extreme/unwanted hair growth, ""hair bumps"" (folliculitis). Skin infections can become worse when this medication is used. Notify your doctor promptly if redness, swelling, or irritation does not improve. Rarely, it is possible this medication will be absorbed from the skin into the bloodstream. This can lead to side effects of too much corticosteroid. These side effects are more likely in children, and in people who use this medication for a long time or over large areas of the skin. Tell your doctor right away if any of the following side effects occur: unusual/extreme tiredness, weight loss, headache, swelling ankles/feet, increased thirst/urination, vision problems. A very serious allergic reaction to this drug is rare. However, seek immediate medical attention if you notice any symptoms of a serious allergic reaction, including: rash, itching/swelling (especially of the face/tongue/throat), severe dizziness, trouble breathing. This is not a complete list of possible side effects. If you notice other effects not listed above, contact your doctor or pharmacist."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uramustine	Uramustine	6194	DB00791	W7KQ46GJ8U	66-75-1				Uramustine or uracil mustard is a chemotherapy drug which belongs to the class of alkylating agents. It is used in lymphatic malignancies such as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. It works by damaging DNA, primarily in cancer cells that preferentially take up the uracil due to their need to make nucleic acids during their rapid cycles of cell division. The DNA damage leads to apoptosis of the affected cells. Bone marrow suppression and nausea are the main side effects. Chemically it is a derivative of nitrogen mustard and uracil.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulfapyridine	Sulfapyridine	5336	DB00891	Y5V2N1KE8U	144-83-2				"Sulfapyridine, original UK spelling sulphapyridine, is a sulfonamide antibacterial. At one time it was commonly referred to as M&B. Sulfapyridine is not prescribed for treatment in humans any more. However, it may be used to treat linear IgA Disease. It is a good antibacterial drug, but its water solubility is very pH dependent. Thus there is a risk of crystallization within the bladder or urethra, which could lead to pain or blockage. Discovered by May & Baker Ltd and logged in their Test Book on 2 November 1937 under Code No M&B693. Successfully used to treat Winston Churchill's bacterial pneumonia in 1942. In a subsequent radio broadcast he said ""This admirable M&B from which I did not suffer any inconvenience, was used at the earliest moment and, after a week's fever, the intruders were repulsed. "" In 1944 M&B693 also saved Nero, the Royal Circus lion, from pneumonia. [Glasgow Evening News January 1944. ] The drug sulfasalazine is structurally one molecule of mesalamine linked to one molecule of sulfapyridine with an azo bond. M & B 693 was one of the first generation of sulphonamide antibiotics, It has been reported as the first chemical cure for pneumonia. It could either be taken in tablet form or the powder could be placed in wounds. It was used so widely during the Second World War that May & Baker had difficulty keeping up with demand. It was later largely superseded by penicillin and sulphonamides."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pirenzepine	Pirenzepine	4848	DB00670	3G0285N20N	28797-61-7				Pirenzepine (Gastrozepin), an M1 selective antagonist, is used in the treatment of peptic ulcers, as it reduces gastric acid secretion and reduces muscle spasm. It is in a class of drugs known as muscarinic receptor antagonists - acetylcholine being the neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system which initiates the rest-and-digest state (as opposed to fight-or-flight), the result being an increase in gastric motility and digestion. It has no effects on the brain and spinal cord as it cannot diffuse through the bloodâ€“brain barrier. Pirenzepine has been investigated for use in myopia control.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Alverine	Alverine	3678	DB01616	46TIR1560O	150-59-4				Alverine is a drug used for functional gastrointestinal disorders. Alverine is a smooth muscle relaxant. Smooth muscle is a type of muscle that is not under voluntary control; it is the muscle present in places such as the gut and uterus. Alverine acts directly on the muscle in the gut, causing it to relax. This prevents the muscle spasms which occur in the gut in conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome and diverticular disease. Diverticular disease is a condition in which small pouches form in the gut lining. These pouches can trap particles of food and become inflamed and painful. In irritable bowel syndrome the normal activity of the gut muscle is lost. The muscle spasms result in symptoms such as heartburn, abdominal pain and bloating, constipation or diarrhoea. By relaxing the gut muscle, alverine citrate relieves the symptoms of this condition. Alverine also relaxes the smooth muscle in the womb (uterus). It is therefore also used to treat painful menstruation, which is caused by muscle spasms in the uterus (dysmenorrhea).

It has sedative, hypnotic and anticonvulsant properties, and was used primarily for the treatment of insomnia. Aprobarbital was never as widely used as more common barbiturate derivatives such as phenobarbital and is now rarely prescribed as it has been replaced by newer drugs with a better safety margin.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butabarbital	Butabarbital	2479	DB00237	P0078O25A9	125-40-6				Butabarbital (trade name Butisol) is a prescription barbiturate sleep aid. Butabarbital has a particularly fast onset of effects and short duration of action compared to other barbiturates, which makes it useful for certain applications such as treating severe insomnia and relieving anxiety before surgical procedures; however it is also relatively dangerous particularly when combined with alcohol, and so is now rarely used, although it is still prescribed in some Eastern European and South American countries. Its intermediate duration of action gives butabarbital an abuse potential slightly lower than secobarbital. Butabarbital is also sold in combination with belladonna alkaloids under the brand name Butibel. The belladonna is added for antispasmodic effect. This product contains a low dose of butabarbital combined with a standardised mix of belladonna alkaloids and is used as an antispasmodic taken to relieve cramping and spasms of the stomach and intestines. They are used also to decrease the amount of acid formed in the stomach. Another similar product is Donnatal, which contains belladonna alkaloids combined with phenobarbital.

It was used in the 1940s-1950s as an agent for inducing anesthesia for surgery, as well as a rapid-acting, short-lasting hypnotic for general use, and has a relatively fast onset of effects and short duration of action. However it can be difficult to control the depth of anesthesia with hexobarbital which makes it quite dangerous, and it has now been replaced by safer drugs in human medicine, usually thiopental would be the barbiturate of choice for this application these days. Hexobarbital is still used in some scientific research.

It stimulates the secretion of gastric acid, pepsin, and intrinsic factor, and has been used as a diagnostic aid as the pentagastrin-stimulated calcitonin test. Pentagastrin binds to the cholecystokinin-B receptor, which is expressed widely in the brain. Activation of these receptors activates the phospholipase C second messenger system. When given intravenously it causes panic attacks. Pentagastrin is also used as a stimulation test to elevate serotonin levels and cause symptoms of carcinoid syndrome. It provokes flushing and is useful in evaluating patients who describe flushing, but have normal or only marginally elevated biochemical markers for carcinoid syndrome. In addition, it has been used to stimulate ectopic gastric mucosa for the detection of Meckels diverticulum by nuclear medicine.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benzoctamine	Benzoctamine	28425		734MM7Y191	17243-09-9		Intravenous, oral	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Benzoctamine is a drug that possesses sedative and anxiolytic properties. It is different from most sedative drugs because in most clinical trials it does not produce respiratory depression, but actually stimulates the respiratory system. When co-administered with other drugs that cause respiratory depression, like morphine, it can cause increased respiratory depression. Peak effects are reached at about an hour, and effects wear off after about 2â€“3 hours. This drug is also used as a sedative in the hospital scene in patients who have respiratory failure. It appears to reduce turnover of serotonin. Its effects can be variable.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bedaquiline	Bedaquiline	5746640		78846I289Y	654653-81-3		Oral		"Bedaquiline (trade name Sirturo, code names TMC207 and R207910) is a diarylquinoline anti-tuberculosis drug, which was discovered by a team led by the Belgian Koen Andries at Janssen Pharmaceutica. It was described for the first time in 2004 at the Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy meeting Late-Breaker Session, after the drug had been in development for over seven years, and a trial of 47 patients showed that it is effective in the treatment of M. Â tuberculosis. It is the first new medicine to fight the infection in more than forty years. Sirturo is the first medicine specifically designed for treating multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis â€” an increasingly common form of the disease that cannot be treated with at least two of the four primary antibiotics used to treat tuberculosis. The standard drugs used to fight the disease were developed in the 1950s and 1960s. Roughly one-third of the world's population is estimated to be infected with the bacteria causing tuberculosis. Bedaquiline was successfully applied in a phase II efficacy study published in 2010; it was developed by Tibotec and the TB Alliance. It is manufactured by Johnson & Johnson (J&J), who sought accelerated approval of the drug, a type of temporary approval for diseases lacking viable treatment options, such as multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis. According to J&J, ""the commercial opportunity is very limited [and and] is part of [the company's effort to] advance innovative medicines that help address serious public-health issues. "" By gaining approval for a drug that treats a neglected disease, J&J will be able to request expedited FDA review of a future drug. It was formally approved for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in tuberculosis (TB) treatment- but it is to be used normally only in cases of multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis, and in an even more resistant category, extensively drug resistant tuberculosis. Multi-drug resistant tuberculosis is defined as tuberculosis cases that do not respond to at least two of the four primary (first-line) antibiotics, developed mostly in the 1950s and 1960s, that are used to treat tuberculosis. The drug has been given a black-box warning for arrhythmias which may cause cardiac arrest."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flibanserin	Flibanserin	6918248		37JK4STR6Z	167933-07-5		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		Flibanserin (code name BIMT-17; proposed trade name Girosa) is a drug that was investigated by Boehringer Ingelheim as a novel, non-hormonal treatment for pre-menopausal women with Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder (HSDD). Development was terminated in October 2010 following a negative report by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. HSDD is the most commonly reported female sexual complaint and characterized by a decrease in sexual desire that causes marked personal distress and/or personal difficulties. According to prevalence studies about 1 in 10 women reported low sexual desire with associated distress, which may be HSDD. The neurobiological pathway of female sexual desire involves interactions among multiple neurotransmitters, sex hormones and various psychosocial factors. Sexual desire is modulated in distinct brain areas by a balance between inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters, serotonin acting as an inhibitor while dopamine and norepinephrine act as a stimulator of sexual desire. Flibanserin is a 5-HT1A receptor agonist and 5-HT2A receptor antagonist that had initially been investigated as an antidepressant. Preclinical evidence suggested that flibanserin targets these receptors preferentially in selective brain areas and helps to restore a balance between these inhibitory and excitatory effects. HSDD has been recognized as a distinct sexual function disorder for more than 30 years.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Afobazole	Afobazole	9862937		HDO6HX6NZU	173352-39-1		Oral		Afobazole is an anxiolytic drug launched in Russia in the early 2000s. It produces anxiolytic and neuroprotective effects without any sedative or muscle relaxant actions, making it more selective in action than many currently used drugs for this application. Its mechanism of action remains poorly defined however, with GABAergic, NGF and BDNF release promoting, MT1 receptor antagonism, MT3 receptor antagonism, and sigma agonism all thought to have some involvement. Clinical trials have shown afobazole to be well tolerated and reasonably effective for the treatment of anxiety, although it has yet to be introduced into widespread clinical use outside of Russia. The compound has not been evaluated by the FDA. It is unscheduled in the US and legal to import by private citizens for personal use.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amiflamine	Amiflamine	71221		NE25WV9C8S	77518-07-1		Oral		Amiflamine (FLA-336) is a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A), thereby being a RIMA, and, to a lesser extent, semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO), as well as a serotonin releasing agent (SRA). It is a derivative of the phenethylamine and amphetamine chemical classes. The (+)-enantiomer is the active stereoisomer. Amiflamine is unique among MAOIs in that it shows preference for inhibiting MAO-A in serotonergic relative to noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons. In other words, at low doses, it can be used to selectively inhibit MAO-A enzymes in serotonin cells, whereas at higher doses it loses its selectivity. This property is attributed to amiflamine's higher affinity for the serotonin transporter over the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters, as transporter-mediated carriage is required for amiflamine to enter monoaminergic neurons.

The antisecretory properties of ebrotidine are similar to those of ranitidine, and approximately 10-fold greater than those of cimetidine. Ebrotidine has anti-Helicobacter pylori activity via inhibition of the urease enzyme and the proteolytic and mucolytic activities of the bacterium. However, its activity is synergistic with a number of antibacterial agents. Ebrotidine counteracts the inhibitory effects of H. pylori lipo-polysaccharides. Ebrotidine has been shown to be as effective as ranitidine for the treatment of gastric or duodenal ulcers or erosive reflux oesophagitis, with significantly better ulcer healing rates (albeit inexplicably) in those who smoke.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ivacaftor	Ivacaftor	16220172		1Y740ILL1Z	873054-44-5		Oral		Ivacaftor (trade name Kalydeco, developed as VX-770) is a potentiator approved for patients with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Ivacaftor was developed by Vertex Pharmaceuticals in conjunction with the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Cystic fibrosis is caused by any one of several defects in a protein, cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, which regulates fluid flow within cells and affects the components of sweat, digestive fluids, and mucus. The defect, which is caused by a mutation in the individual's DNA, can be in any of several locations along the protein, each of which interferes with a different function of the protein. G551D is a standard amino acid abbreviation for a mutation in which the amino acid glycine (G) in position 551 is replaced with aspartic acid (D). G551D is characterized by a dysfunctional CFTR protein on the cell surface. In the case of G551D, the protein is trafficked to the correct area, the epithelial cell surface, but once there the protein cannot transport chloride through the channel. Ivacaftor, a CFTR potentiator, improves the transport of chloride through the ion channel by binding to the channels directly to induce a non-conventional mode of gating which in turn increases the probability that the channel is open. G551D accounts for only 4-5% cases of cystic fibrosis. Ivacaftor was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in January of 2012 for administration in cystic fibrosis patients having the G551D mutation. Ivacaftor costs upwards of $294,000 for a year's supply. Vertex said it would make the drug available free to patients in the United States with no insurance and a household income of under $150,000. The drug was developed with the help of $75 million from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. Ivacaftor is currently being evaluated for other cystic fibrosis mutations including F508del, the most common defect occurring in approximately 70% of the cystic fibrosis population.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ladostigil	Ladostigil	208907		SW3H1USR4Q	209349-27-4		Oral		Ladostigil (TV-3,326) is a novel neuroprotective agent being investigated for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease, Lewy body disease, and Parkinson's disease. It acts as a reversible acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase inhibitor, and an irreversible monoamine oxidase B inhibitor, and combines the mechanisms of action of older drugs like rivastigmine and rasagiline into a single molecule. In addition to its neuroprotective properties, ladostigil enhances the expression of neurotrophic factors like GDNF and BDNF, and may be capable of reversing some of the damage seen in neurodegenerative diseases via the induction of neurogenesis. Ladostigil also has antidepressant effects, and may be useful for treating comorbid depression and anxiety often seen in such diseases as well.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nemifitide	Nemifitide	177265		RO19OXA9NG	173240-15-8		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subcutaneous_injection		Nemifitide (INN-00835) is a novel antidepressant drug with a pentapeptide structure similar to that of melanocyte-inhibiting factor (MIF-1) and the amino acid sequence 4-F-Phe-4-OH-Pro-Arg-Gly-Trp-NH2. It is under development by Tetragenex for the treatment of major depressive disorder. It has been given to over 430 people over the course of 12 clinical trials throughout a little over the past decade and has reached Phase III studies, but has not yet been approved for marketing in any country. Nemifitide has shown mixed efficacy in alleviating depressive symptoms, but in the cases in which it has worked it has proven to have a rapid onset of action (~5â€“7 days), few to no side effects, and an excellent safety profile. However, it is inactive orally and must be administered via subcutaneous injection. Remarkably, despite having a very short half-life of only 15â€“30 minutes, in most or all studies assessing its efficacy nemifitide has been administered merely once daily via the subcutaneous route and yet is effective for depression. The mechanism of action of nemifitide is unclear, but since MIF-1 has been demonstrated to have similar antidepressant effects it may act in an analogous manner. Possibly of interest however is that nemifitide binds to several receptors including 5-HT2A (where it has been shown to act as an antagonist), NPY1, bombesin, and MC4 and MC5, though at only micromolar concentrations. Whether any of these relatively weak actions are of any clinical significance is unclear.

It is chemically related to chlorpromazine, but has negligible antipsychotic activity and produces few extrapyramidal side effects. Pipamazine was introduced to the U.S. market in 1959 by G. D. Searle & Company. It was advertised for morning sickness and postoperative nausea and vomiting, and was claimed to reduce the need for postoperative analgesia. It was eventually withdrawn from the U.S. market in 1969, after reports of hepatotoxicity (liver injury). There is very little published information on pipamazine; it is mostly absent from modern-day sources, apart from a few passing mentions in the pharmacological literature.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piperoxan	Piperoxan	6040		9ZCS27634Y	59-39-2		Oral		Piperoxan, also known as benodaine, is a drug which was the very first antihistamine to be discovered. This compound, derived from benzodioxan, was prepared in the early 1930s by Daniel Bovet and Ernest Fourneau at the Pasteur Institute in France. Formerly investigated by Fourneau as an Î±-adrenergic-blocking agent, they demonstrated that it also antagonized histamine-induced bronchospasm in guinea pigs, and published their findings in 1933. Bovet went on to win the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his contribution, and one of their students, Anne-Marie Staub, published the first structure-activity relationship (SAR) study of antihistamines in 1939.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piquindone	Piquindone	121903		O1C9WXY65C	78541-97-6		Oral		Piquindone (Ro 22-1319) is an atypical antipsychotic with a tricyclic structure that was developed in the 1980s but was never marketed. It acts as a selective D2 receptor antagonist, though based on its effects profile its selectivity may be considered controversial. Unlike most other D2 receptor ligands, piquindone displays Na-dependent binding, a property it shares with tropapride, zetidoline, and metoclopramide. In clinical trials piquindone was found to possess moderate efficacy in treating positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and notably, was also modestly effective for negative symptoms, though this was just under statistical significance. Additionally, relative to haloperidol, it was found to possesses significantly fewer extrapyramidal symptoms and had a much lower propensity for inducing tardive dyskinesia, indicating its atypical nature. In addition to psychosis, piquindone has also been found to be effective in the treatment of Tourette's syndrome in numerous clinical studies.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Quinupramine	Quinupramine	93154		29O61HFF4L	31721-17-2		Oral		Quinupramine (Kevopril, Kinupril, Adeprim, Quinuprine) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) used in Europe for the treatment of depression. On a pharmacological level, quinupramine acts in vitro as a strong muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist and H1 receptor antagonist, moderate 5-HT2 receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. It has negligible affinity for the Î±1-adrenergic, Î±2-adrenergic, Î²-adrenergic, and D2 receptors. Clinically, quinupramine is reported to be stimulating similarly to imipramine, desipramine, and demexiptiline.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tafamidis	Tafamidis	11001318		8FG9H9D31J	594839-88-0		Oral		Tafamidis (INN, or Fx-1006A, trade name Vyndaqel) is a drug for the amelioration of transthyretin-related hereditary amyloidosis (also familial amyloid polyneuropathy, or FAP), a rare but deadly neurodegenerative disease. The drug was approved by the European Medicines Agency in November 2011. The marketed drug, a meglumine salt, has completed an 18 month placebo controlled phase II/III clinical trial, and an 18 month extension study which provides evidence that tafamidis slows progression of Familial amyloid polyneuropathy. Tafamidis (20Â mg once daily) is used in adult patients with an early stage (stage 1) of familial amyloidotic polyneuropathy. Tafamidis was discovered in the Jeffery W. Kelly Laboratory at The Scripps Research Institute using a structure-based drug design strategy and was developed at FoldRx pharmaceuticals, a biotechnology company led by Richard Labaudiniere that was acquired by Pfizer in 2010. Tafamidis functions by kinetic stabilization of the correctly folded tetrameric form of the transthyretin (TTR) protein. In patients with FAP, this protein dissociates in a process that is rate limiting for aggregation including amyloid fibril formation, causing failure of the autonomic nervous system and/or the peripheral nervous system initially and later failure of the heart. Kinetic Stabilization of tetrameric transthyretin in familial amyloid polyneuropathy patients provides the first pharmacologic evidence that the process of amyloid fibril formation causes this disease, as treatment with tafamidis dramatically slows the process of amyloid fibril formation and the degeneration of post-mitotic tissue. The process of wild type transthyretin amyloidogenesis also appears to cause senile systemic amyloidosis leading to cardiomyopathy as the prominent phenotype Some mutants of transthyretin, including V122I primarily found in individuals of African descent, are destabilizing enabling heterotetramer dissociation, monomer misfolding, and subsequent misassembly of transthyretin into a variety of aggregate structures including amyloid fibrils leading to familial amyloid cardiomyopathy. While there is clinical evidence from a small number of patients that tafamidis slows the progression of the transthyretin cardiomyopathies, this has yet to be demonstrated in a placebo controlled clinical trial.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenazocine	Phenazocine	14707		J0ND6N0AQC	127-35-5		Oral		Phenazocine (brand names Prinadol, Narphen) is an opioid analgesic drug, which is related to pentazocine and has a similar profile of effects. Effects of phenazocine include analgesia and euphoria, also may include dysphoria and hallucinations at high doses, most likely due to action at Îº-opioid and Ïƒ receptors. Phenazocine appears to be a much stronger analgesic with fewer side effects than pentazocine, probably due to a more favorable Î¼/Îº binding ratio. Phenazocine is a much more potent analgesic than pentazocine and other drugs in the benzomorphan series, most probably due to the presence of an N-phenethyl substitution, which is known to boost Î¼-opioid activity in many classes of opioid analgesics. Consequently phenazocine is some 4x the potency of morphine as an analgesic. Also it does not cause spasm of the sphincter of Oddi, making it more suitable than morphine for the treatment of biliary or pancreatic pain.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metopon	Metopon	5359353		94XZ1CC69D	143-52-2				Metopon (5-methyldihydromorphone) is an opiate analogue that is a methylated derivative of hydromorphone which was invented in 1948 as an analgesic. Metopon is sometimes used in medicine, but although longer acting than hydromorphone, metopon is less potent and its oral bioavailability, while higher than that of morphine, is still fairly low, so generally metopon has few advantages to distinguish it from other, more commonly used opioid analgesics, although it does have a slightly lower tendency to produce nausea and respiratory depression compared to morphine. In Canada as of 1948, the hydrochloride of metopon (free base conversion ratio .891, molecular weight 335.8) was available only for oral administration for malignant pain and for maintenance of those habituated to morphine; the only dosage form available was singly scored 8Â mg tablets. It was manufactured by Parke, Davis, & Co. , and was only for sale to doctors and hospitals. Parke, Davis & Co. did not sell metopon to pharmacies. It is unknown whether metopon tablets are still manufactured and sold in Canada. Metopon tablets, ampoules, and suppositories are available in Switzerland, Austria, Germany, and other countries in Continental Europe and the drug is used in Patient Controlled Analgesia pumps for severe chronic pain in particular. Metopon is listed under Schedule II of the US Controlled Substances Act 1970, meaning it has an accepted medical use, but at this time it is not produced commercially and is seen only in laboratory research. It did see some use in medicine -- oncology in particular -- in the USA in the 1950s. CAS number 124-92-5 (Metopon hydrochloride)

It was used primarily as an anticonvulsant although it has now largely been replaced by newer drugs with improved safety profiles. Other uses for allobarbital included as an adjutant to boost the activity of analgesic drugs, and use in the treatment of insomnia and anxiety. Allobarbital was never particularly widely used compared to better known barbiturates such as phenobarbital and secobarbital, although it saw more use in some European countries such as Bulgaria and Slovakia, and is still used in for example Poland, but only as compound.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bicuculline	Bicuculline	10237		Y37615DVKC	485-49-4				Bicuculline is a light-sensitive competitive antagonist of GABAA receptors. It was originally identified in 1932 in plant alkaloid extracts and has been isolated from Dicentra cucullaria, Adlumia fungosa, Fumariaceae, and several Corydalis species. Since it blocks the inhibitory action of GABA receptors, the action of bicuculline mimics epilepsy. This property is utilized in laboratories across the world in the in vitro study of epilepsy, generally in hippocampal or cortical neurons in prepared brain slices from rodents. This compound is also routinely used to isolate glutamatergic (excitatory amino acid) receptor function. The action of bicuculline is primarily on the ionotropic GABAA receptors, which are ligand-gated ion channels concerned chiefly with the passing of chloride ions across the cell membrane, thus promoting an inhibitory influence on the target neuron. These receptors are the major targets for benzodiazepines and related anxiolytic drugs. The half-maximal inhibitory concentration of bicuculline on GABAA receptors is 3 Î¼M. In addition to being a potent GABAA receptor antagonist, bicuculine can be used to block Ca-activated potassium channels. Sensitivity to bicuculline is defined by IUPHAR as a major criterion in the definition of GABAA receptorsÂ 
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dimethocaine	Dimethocaine	7177		R3L4A6GOWZ	94-15-5				"Dimethocaine (Larocaine) is a local anesthetic with stimulant properties that some studies have shown to be half the potency of cocaine. Anecdotal user reports indicate only 2/3 stimulating effects. The drug however also presents strain on the cardiovascular systems, like cocaine(60%), with the potential to induce tachycardia which could be problematic for those who continuously redose. Additional reports of respiratory arrest have been noted. When a product sold online in the UK in June 2010, advertised as dimethocaine was tested, it was found to in fact be a mixture of caffeine and lidocaine, and the lack of any dopaminergic stimulant ingredient in such mixes may explain the limited recreational effects reported by many users. Other samples tested have however been shown to contain genuine dimethocaine, and one branded ""bath salt"" product containing primarily dimethocaine as the active ingredient, was noted to have been particularly subject to abuse by intravenous drug users in Ireland. The p-NH2 pharmacophore in dimethocaine is a relatively uncommon structural feature for a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, although it is also present in other compounds such as GYKI-52895 and RTI-29."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iopanoic_acid	Iopanoic acid	3735		FE9794P71J	96-83-3				Iopanoic acid is an iodine-containing radiocontrast medium used in cholecystography. Both iopanoic acid and ipodate sodium are potent inhibitors of thyroid hormone release from thyroid gland, as well as of peripheral conversion of thyroxine (T4) to triiodothyronine (T3). These compounds inhibit 5'deiodinase (5'DID-1 and 5'DID-2) enzymes, which catalyse T4-T3 conversion in the thyroid cell, liver, kidney, skeletal muscle, heart, brain, pituitary. This accounts for the dramatic improvement in both subjective and objective symptoms of hyperthyroidism, particularly when they are used as an adjunctive therapy with thioamides. These are less toxic, as iodine is covalently bound in these compounds. They can be used in the treatment of patients with severe thyrotoxicosis (thyroid storm) and significant morbidity (e.g. , myocardial infarction, or stroke) for rapid control of elevated plasma triiodothyronine concentrations. The use of iopanoic acid for treatment of thyrotoxicosis has been discontinued in the United States. In addition to inhibiting deiodinase enzymes, iopanoic acid is also a substrate of type 1 deiodinase. Iopanoic acid underwent monodeiodination in the presence of type 1 deiodinase in a microsomal mouse liver preparation.

Like ritonavir (Norvir), cobicistat is of interest not for its anti-HIV properties, but rather its ability to inhibit liver enzymes that metabolize other medications used to treat HIV, notably elvitegravir, an HIV integrase inhibitor currently under investigation itself. By combining cobicistat with elvitegravir, higher concentrations of elvitgravir are achieved in the body with lower dosing, theoretically enhancing elvitgravir's viral suppression while diminishing its adverse side-effects. In contrast with ritonavir, the only currently approved booster, cobicistat has no anti-HIV activity of its own. Cobicistat is a component of the four-drug, fixed-dose combination HIV treatment elvitegravir/cobicistat/emtricitabine/tenofovir (known as the ""Quad Pill"" or Stribild). The Quad Pill/Stribild was approved by the FDA in August 2012 for use in the United States and is owned by Gilead Sciences.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lirequinil	Lirequinil	3045375		2VUW1087AD	143943-73-1				Lirequinil (Ro41-3696) is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic drug which binds to benzodiazepine sites on the GABAA receptor. In human clinical trials, lirequinil was found to have similar efficacy to zolpidem, with less side effects such as clumsiness and memory impairment. However it was also much slower acting than zolpidem, with peak plasma concentrations not reached until 2.5 hours after oral administration, and its O-desethyl metabolite Ro41-3290 is also active with a half-life of 8 hours. This meant that while effective as a hypnotic, lirequinil failed to prove superior to zolpidem due to producing more next-day sedation, and it has not been adopted for clinical use. It was developed by a team at Hoffmann-La Roche in the 1990s.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Roxindole	Roxindole	219050		43227SMS0O	112192-04-8				Roxindole (EMD-49,980) is a dopaminergic and serotonergic drug which was originally developed for the treatment of schizophrenia. In clinical trials its antipsychotic efficacy was only modest but it was unexpectedly found to produce potent and rapid antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. As a result, roxindole was further researched for the treatment of depression instead. It has also been investigated as a therapy for Parkinson's disease and prolactinoma. Roxindole acts as an agonist at the following receptors: D2 receptor (pKi = 8.55) D3 receptor (pKi = 8.93) D4 receptor (pKi = 8.23) 5-HT1A receptor (pKi = 9.42) At D2 and possibly D3 receptors roxindole is a partial agonist with preferential actions at autoreceptors and has been touted as a 'selective' autoreceptor agonist, hence the justification of its application as an antipsychotic. It is also a serotonin reuptake inhibitor (IC50 = 1.4 nM) and has been reported to act as a 5-HT2A receptor antagonist as well.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/CX614	CX614	6451148		87V631480W	191744-13-5				CX-614 is an ampakine drug developed by Cortex Pharmaceuticals. It has been investigated for its effect on AMPA receptors. Chronic CX-614 treatments produce rapid increases in the synthesis of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor BDNF which has very important effects on synaptic plasticity and may have applications in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Acute CX-614 treatments activate local mRNA translation (new protein synthesis) within dendrites and this is mediated by a fast upregulation of BDNF release. CX-614-dependent release of BDNF rapidly increases translation of proteins that are important for synaptic plasticity such as ARC/Arg3.1 and CaMKIIalpha. CX-614 has also been proposed as a treatment for conditions such as depression and schizophrenia, but produces receptor downregulation following chronic administration, which might limit the potential for extended use. However, downregulation of AMPA receptors with prolonged CX-614 administration can be avoided by designing and using short and intermittent treatment protocols, which could still upregulate BDNF protein levels without reducing the levels of AMPA receptors. Importantly, such short and intermittent treatment protocols are neuroprotective against neurotoxicity induced with MPTP and MPP in cultured midbrain (mesencephalic) and hippocampal organotypic slices. These results uncovered the neuroprotective effects of CX-614 and indicated that opened the way for further experimentation with CX-614 as an important new treatment for Parkinson's Disease and Alzheimer's Disease. CX-614 has also been shown to reduce the behavioural effects of methamphetamine in mice, and may have application in the treatment of stimulant abuse.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bapineuzumab	Bapineuzumab			NC11WKO35D	648895-38-9				Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody that acts on the nervous system and may have potential therapeutic value for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and possibly glaucoma. However, in 2012 it failed to produce significant cognitive improvements in patients in two major trials, despite lowering key biomarkers of AD, amyloid brain plaque and phophorylated Tau protein in CSF. Bapineuzumab has been shown to recognise the extreme N-terminal 5 residues of AÎ² peptide in a helical conformation (4HIX. pdb) stabilized by internal hydrogen bonds involving the first three amino acids. Bapineuzumab is an antibody to the beta-amyloid (AÎ²) plaques that are believed to underlie Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. In previous clinical trials for vaccination against human beta amyloid, called AN-1792, patients with Alzheimer's disease using active immunization had positive outcomes with removal of plaques, but 6% of subjects developed aseptic meningitis and the trial was stopped. Bapineuzumab was being co-developed by the pharmaceutical companies Ã‰lan and Wyeth and entered Phase III trials in December 2007. In 2008 a Johnson & Johnson affiliate acquired a substantial portion of Ã‰lan's assets related to the Alzheimer's immunotherapy program, which Elan had shared with Wyeth. The program is continuing with Pfizer, which acquired Wyeth in 2009. In patients receiving the highest dose, e.g. 2Â mg, MRI scans showed an accumulation of water in brain tissue (vasogenic edema). No health risks were found in subjects receiving either 0.5 or 1Â mg of bapineuzumab. Patients who have been receiving or have been scheduled to receive the highest dose will be either removed from the trials or switched to lower doses. The efficacy of drugs targeted to brain plaques in Alzheimer's patients has been called into question, although such drugs may stil be effective for prophylaxis if given to individuals who have not yet developed clinical symptoms. On August 6, 2012, Pfizer Inc. and Johnson & Johnson said they are ending development of an intravenous formulation of bapineuzumab. Testing showed the drug did not work better than placebo in two late-stage trials in patients who had mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zotarolimus	Zotarolimus			H4GXR80IZE	221877-54-9				Zotarolimus is an immunosuppressant. It is a semi-synthetic derivative of rapamycin. It was designed for use in stents with phosphorylcholine as a carrier. Coronary stents reduce early complications and improve late clinical outcomes in patients needing interventional cardiology. The first human coronary stent implantation was first performed in 1986 by Puel et al. However, there are complications associated with stent use, development of thrombosis which impedes the efficiency of coronary stents, haemorrhagic and restenosis complications are problems associated with stents. These complications have prompted the development of drug-eluting stents. Stents are bound by a membrane consisting of polymers which not only slowly release Zotarolimus and its derivatives into the surrounding tissues but also do not invoke an inflammatory response by the body. Medtronic are using Zotarolimus as the anti-proliferative agent in the polymer coating of their Endeavor and Resolute products.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Losmapimod	Losmapimod	11552706		F2DQF16BXE					Losmapimod (GW856553X) is a drug developed by GlaxoSmithKline which acts as a selective inhibitor of the enzyme family known as p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases. p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases are mediators of inflammation. A Phase II human clinical trial for the treatment of COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease) is underway. Losmapimod is being studied for cardiovascular disease. A Phase II trial to study its effects in Myocardial infarction (heart attack) is ongoing. Inhibiting these enzymes has been shown to produce antidepressant and antipsychotic effects in animal studies, with the mechanism thought to involve increased neurogenesis probably related to BDNF release. Losmapimod has completed Phase II human clinical trials for the treatment of depression although its safety and efficacy have yet to be proven in further trials.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/19-Norandrostenedione	19-Norandrostenedione	92834	DB01434		734-32-7		Oral		"19-Norandrostenedione (4-estrene-3,17-dione, NOR) is a precursor of the anabolic steroid nandrolone. Until 2005 19-Norandrostenedione was available without prescription in United States, where it was marketed as a prohormone, but it is now classified as a Schedule III drug. It is also banned from use in many sports, including the Olympic Games, under the World Anti-Doping Code. 19-Norandrostenedione is readily metabolized to nandrolone after oral administration, but its potency to transactivate the androgen receptor dependent reporter gene expression is 10 times lower as compared to dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Scientific studies have shown that oral administration of 19-norandrostenedione is ""a very ineffective strategy for stimulating skeletal muscle mass increases but may be associated with side effects"". In vivo experiments in castrated rats demonstrated that subcutaneous treatment with 19-norandrostenedione resulted only in a stimulation of the weight of the levator ani muscle, while the prostate and seminal vesicle weights remained completely unaffected. In contrast to its metabolite nandrolone, 19-norandrostenedione highly selectively stimulates the growth of the skeletal muscles but has only weak androgenic properties. In the early 2000s, contamination of androstenedione products with traces of 19-norandrostenedione caused false positives for doping tests for nandrolone because 19-norandrosterone is a metabolite of both nandrolone and 19-norandrostenedione. In a randomized controlled trial trace contamination of androstenedione with 19-norandrostenedione was sufficient for users of androstendione to test positive for nandrolone. This detail became less relevant after 19-norandrostenedione and androstenedione were banned by major sporting bodies."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Staurosporine	Staurosporine	44259	DB02010		62996-74-1				Staurosporine (antibiotic AM-2282 or STS) is a natural product originally isolated in 1977 from the bacterium Streptomyces staurosporeus. It was the first of over 50 alkaloids to be isolated with this type of bis-indole chemical structure. The chemical structure of staurosporine was elucidated by X-ray analysis of a single crystal and the absolute stereochemical configuration by the same method in 1994. Staurosporine was discovered to have biological activities ranging from anti-fungal to anti-hypertensive. The interest in these activities resulted in a large investigative effort in chemistry and biology and the discovery of the potential for anti-cancer treatment. The main biological activity of staurosporine is the inhibition of protein kinases through the prevention of ATP binding to the kinase. This is achieved through the stronger affinity of staurosporine to the ATP-binding site on the kinase. Staurosporine is a prototypical ATP-competitive kinase inhibitor in that it binds to many kinases with high affinity, though with little selectivity. Structural analysis of kinase pockets demonstrated that main chain atoms which are conserved in their relative positions to staurosporine contributes to staurosporine promiscuity. This lack of specificity has precluded its clinical use, but has made it a valuable research tool. In research, staurosporine is used to induce apoptosis. The mechanism of how it mediates this is not well understood. It has been found that one way in which staurosporine induces apoptosis is by activating caspase-3. Staurosporine is the precursor of the novel protein kinase inhibitor midostaurin (PKC412). Besides midostaurin, staurosporine is also used as a starting material in the commercial synthesis of K252c (also called staurosporine aglycone). In the natural biosynthetic pathway, K252c is a precursor of staurosporine.

It is a racemic mixture of alphacetylmethadol (Î±-acetylmethadol) and betacetylmethadol (Î²-acetylmethadol), which are in turn racemic mixtures of levacetylmethadol (LAAM; -Î±-acetylmethadol) and -Î±-acetylmethadol and -Î²-acetylmethadol and -Î²-acetylmethadol, respectively. Hence, acetylmethadol has four possible optical isomers. All of these isomers have been shown to partially or fully substitute for the discriminative stimulus effects of heroin in rats, and thus it can be inferred that, in addition to LAAM which is used clinically as such, they are all likely to be active opioid analgesics in humans. In the United States, acetylmethadol and its individual isomers are all Schedule I drugs under the Controlled Substances Act.

Compared with its precursor, sucrose, inverted sugar is sweeter and its products tend to retain moisture and are less prone to crystallisation. Inverted sugar is therefore valued by bakers, who refer to the syrup as trimoline or invert syrup. In technical terms, sucrose is a disaccharide, which means that it is a molecule derived from two simple sugars. In the case of sucrose, these monosaccharide building blocks are fructose and glucose. The splitting of sucrose is a hydrolysis reaction. The hydrolysis can be induced simply by heating an aqueous solution of sucrose, but more commonly, catalysts are added to accelerate the conversion. The biological catalysts that are added are called sucrases (in animals) and invertases (in plants). Sucrases and invertases are types of glycoside hydrolase enzymes. Acid, such as lemon juice or cream of tartar, also accelerates the conversion of sucrose to invert.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethyl_glucuronide	Ethyl glucuronide	152226			17685-04-0		N/A		"Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) is a metabolite of ethyl alcohol which is formed in the body by glucuronidation following exposure to ethanol, such as by drinking alcoholic beverages. It is used as a biomarker to test for ethanol use and to monitor to document alcohol abstinence in situations where drinking is prohibited, such as by the military, in professional monitoring programs (health professionals, attorneys, airline pilots in recovery from addictions), in schools, liver transplant clinics, or in recovering alcoholic patients. In addition to its use to monitor abstinence and detect drinking EtG also has potential for monitoring amount of alcohol use over time because it can be detected in hair and nails. A disadvantage of the test is that because EtG can be detected in samples at very low levels, it can also be positive after exposure to alcohol from non-beverage sources, or incidental exposure, which can lead to false positives. The sources of possible exposure in the environment are numerous and include alcohol in mouthwash, foods, over-the-counter medications, and even from inhalation of alcohol from topical use. It is impossible to distinguish small amounts of drinking from extraneous exposure to alcohol. The U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration has cautioned that the test is ""scientifically unsupportable as the sole basis for legal or disciplinary action"" because the highly-sensitive tests ""are not able to distinguish between alcohol absorbed into the body from exposure to many common commercial and household products containing alcohol or from the actual consumption of alcohol."""
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ajmalicine	Ajmalicine	251561			483-04-5		Oral		Ajmalicine, also known as Î´-yohimbine or raubasine, is an antihypertensive drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure. It has been marketed under numerous brand names including Card-Lamuran, Circolene, Cristanyl, Duxil, Duxor, Hydroxysarpon, Iskedyl, Isosarpan, Isquebral, Lamuran, Melanex, Saltucin Co, Salvalion, and Sarpan. It is also an alkaloid found naturally in various plants such as Rauwolfia spp. , Catharanthus roseus, and Mitragyna speciosa. Ajmalicine is structurally related to yohimbine, rauwolscine, and other yohimban derivatives. Like corynanthine, it acts as a Î±1-adrenergic receptor antagonist with preferential actions over Î±2-adrenergic receptors, underlying its hypotensive rather than hypertensive effects.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corynanthine	Corynanthine	92766			483-10-3		Oral		Corynanthine, also known as rauhimbine, is an alkaloid found in the Rauwolfia and Pausinystalia (formerly known as Corynanthe) genera of plants. It is one of the two diastereoisomers of yohimbine, the other being rauwolscine. It is also related to ajmalicine. Corynanthine acts as an Î±1-adrenergic and Î±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with approximately 10-fold selectivity for the former site over the latter. This is in contrast to yohimbine and rauwolscine which have around 30-fold higher affinity for Î±2-adrenergic over Î±1-adrenergic. As a result, corynanthine is not a stimulant (or an aphrodisiac for that matter), but a depressant, and likely plays a role in the antihypertensive properties of Rauwolfia extracts.

It was first introduced in 1952 by Upjohn in the United States, and has been in widespread use since. Estradiol cypionate is absorbed more slowly than estradiol itself, and for that reason, it can be administered less often. Compared to other commonly used estradiol esters, via the intramuscular route, estradiol cypionate was found to have the longest duration of action with a duration of ~11 days, while estradiol benzoate and estradiol valerate were found to last for 4â€“5 days and 7â€“8 days, respectively.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jimscaline	Jimscaline	11673493			890309-57-6		Oral		Jimscaline (C-methanamine) is a conformationally-restricted derivative of the cactus-derived hallucinogen mescaline, which was discovered in 2006 by a team at Purdue University led by David E. Nichols. It acts as a potent agonist for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors with the more active (R)-enantiomer having a Ki of 69 nM at the human 5-HT2A receptor, and around three times the potency of mescaline in drug-substitution experiments in animals. This discovery that the side chain of the phenethylamine hallucinogens could be constrained to give chiral ligands with increased activity then led to the later development of the super-potent benzocyclobutene derivative TCB-2.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/PNU-99,194	PNU-99,194	5626			82668-33-5		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		PNU-99,194(A) (or U-99,194) is a drug which acts as a moderately selective D3 receptor antagonist with ~15-30-fold preference for D3 over the D2 subtype. Though it has substantially greater preference for D3 over D2, the latter receptor does still play some role in its effects, as evidenced by the fact that PNU-99,194 weakly stimulates both prolactin secretion and striatal dopamine synthesis, actions it does not share with the more selective (100-fold) D3 receptor antagonists S-14,297 and GR-103,691. In rodent studies, low doses of PNU-99,194 produce conditioned place preference (CPP) with no effect on intracranial self-stimulation (ICSS), whereas low doses of D3 agonists like 7-OH-DPAT inhibit ICSS behavior and cause conditioned place aversion (CPA). In contrast, high doses of PNU-99,194 produce CPA and inhibit ICSS, while high doses of 7-OH-DPAT result in the opposite. Paralleling this, low doses of PNU-99,194 and 7-OH-DPAT induce hyperactivity and hypoactivity, respectively, whereas the inverse is seen at high doses with both agents. These data indicate that the D3 receptor has biphasic effects on reward mechanisms and locomotor activity, likely due to opposing roles of autoreceptors versus postsynaptic receptors. Other effects of PNU-99,194 at low doses in rodents include increased nociceptive responses, hypothermia, anxiolysis, and facilitation of learning and memory, as well as augmentation and inhibition, respectively, of amphetamine-induced reward and behavioral sensitization, and reversal of morphine-induced CPP. At high doses it inhibits the self-administration of cocaine in both rats and monkeys.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenylisobutylamine	Phenylisobutylamine	103771			53309-89-0		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		Phenylisobutylamine, also known as Î±-ethylphenethylamine or AEPEA, is a stimulant drug of the phenethylamine class. It is a higher homologue of amphetamine, differing from amphetamine's molecular structure only by the substitution of the methyl group at the alpha position of the side chain with an ethyl group. Compared to amphetamine, phenylisobutylamine has strongly reduced dopaminergic effects, and instead acts as a selective norepinephrine releasing agent. The dextro isomer of phenylisobutylamine partially substitutes for dextroamphetamine in rats. A number of derivatives of phenylisobutylamine are known, including BDB, MBDB, EBDB, butylone (bk-MBDB), eutylone (bk-EBDB), Ariadne (Î±-Et-DOM), 4-CAB, and 4-MAB.

Identified through structure-activity relationship studies on an older mGluR5 antagonist MPEP, MTEP has subsequently itself acted as a lead compound for newer and even more improved drugs. MTEP is both more potent and more selective than MPEP as a mGluR5 antagonist, and produces similar neuroprotective, antidepressant, analgesic, and anxiolytic effects but with either similar or higher efficacy depending on the test used. MTEP also has similar efficacy to MPEP in reducing the symptoms of morphine withdrawal, and has anti-addictive effects in a variety of animal models, both reducing ethanol self-administration, and also decreasing the addictive effects of nicotine, cocaine and methamphetamine.

It has anxiolytic effects in animal studies, and is also used for investigating the function of the 5-HT2B receptor in a range of other tissues. BW-723C86 is actually a mixed 5-HT2B / 5-HT2C agonist, and while it has good selectivity over 5-HT2A and other serotonin receptor subtypes, it has only around 3x selectivity for 2B over 2C and so is much less selective than most research ligands, but no superior 5-HT2B agonist was available until the potent and selective 5-HT2B activity of 6-APB was discovered in 2012. Highly selective 5-HT2C antagonists are available however, and so a combination of BW-723C86 with a selective 5-HT2C antagonist allows 5-HT2B mediated responses to be studied in isolation.

HU-210 is 100 to 800 times more potent than natural THC from cannabis and has an extended duration of action. HU-210 is the (â€“)-1,1-dimethylheptyl analog of 11-hydroxy- Î”- tetrahydrocannabinol; in some references it is called 1,1-dimethylheptyl- 11-hydroxytetrahydrocannabinol. The abbreviation ""HU"" stands for Hebrew University. The (+) enantiomer of HU-210 has almost all of the cannabinoid activity, with the (âˆ’) enantiomer HU-211 being inactive as a cannabinoid but instead acting as an NMDA antagonist having neuroprotective effects. HU-210 promotes proliferation, but not differentiation, of cultured embryonic hippocampal neural stem and progenitor cells likely via a sequential activation of CB1 receptors, Gi/o proteins, and ERK signaling. It was also indicated by this increased neural growth to entail antianxiety and antidepressant effects. HU-210, alongside other synthetic cannabinoids like WIN 55,212-2 and JWH-133, is implicated in preventing the inflammation caused by amyloid beta proteins involved in Alzheimer's disease, in addition to preventing cognitive impairment and loss of neuronal markers. This anti-inflammatory action is induced through the activation of cannabinoid receptors, which prevents microglial activation that elicits the inflammation. In addition, cannabinoids completely abolish neurotoxicity related to microglia activation in rat models. HU-210 is a potent analgesic with many of the same effects as natural THC."

In animal tests, both 7,N,N-TMT and 5-MeO-7,N,N-TMT produced behavioural responses similar to those of hallucinogenic drugs such as DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, but compounds with larger 7-position substituents such as 7-ethyl-DMT and 7-bromo-DMT did not produce hallucinogen-appropriate responding despite high 5-HT2 receptor binding affinity, suggesting these may be antagonists or weak partial agonists for the 5-HT2 receptors. The related compound 7-MeO-MiPT was also found to be inactive, suggesting that the 7-position has poor tolerance for bulky groups at this position, at least if agonist activity is desired.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/7,N,N-TMT	7,N,N-TMT	47747			65882-39-5				7,N,N-Trimethyltryptamine (7-Methyl-DMT, 7-TMT), is a tryptamine derivative which acts as an agonist at the 5-HT2 serotonin receptors. In animal tests, both 7-TMT and its 5-methoxy derivative 5-MeO-7-TMT produced behavioural responses similar to those of hallucinogenic drugs such as DMT, but the larger 7-ethyl and 7-bromo derivatives of DMT did not produce hallucinogen-appropriate responding despite having higher 5-HT2 receptor affinity in vitro. 7-TMT also weakly inhibits reuptake of serotonin but with little effect on dopamine or noradrenaline reuptake.

Replacing the aromatic 3-benzoyl or 3-naphthoyl group found in most indole derived cannabinoids with the 3-tetramethylcyclopropylmethanone group, imparts significant selectivity for CB2, and A-796,260 was found to be a highly selective CB2 agonist with little affinity for CB1, having a CB2 Ki of 4.6 nM vs 945 nM at CB1. It has potent analgesic and anti-inflammatory actions in animal models, being especially effective in models of neuropathic pain, but without producing cannabis-like behavioral effects.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/A-834,735	A-834,735	11544639			895155-57-4				A-834,735 is a drug developed by Abbott Laboratories that acts as a potent cannabinoid receptor full agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, with a Ki of 12nM at CB1 and 0.21nM at CB2. Replacing the aromatic 3-benzoyl or 3-naphthoyl group found in most indole derived cannabinoids, with the 3-tetramethylcyclopropylmethanone group of A-834,735 and related compounds, imparts significant selectivity for CB2, with most compounds from this group found to be highly selective CB2 agonists with little affinity for CB1. However low nanomolar CB1 binding affinity is retained with certain heterocyclic 1-position substituents such as (N-methylpiperidin-2-yl)methyl, or the (tetrahydropyran-4-yl)methyl substituent of A-834,735, resulting in compounds that still show significant affinity and efficacy at both receptors despite being CB2 selective overall.

It was the first non-peptide antagonist developed for the Y1 receptor and has been widely used to help determine its functions in the body. Activation of Y1 is thought to be involved in functions such as regulation of appetite and anxiety, and BIBP-3226 has anxiogenic and anorectic effects, as well as blocking the Y1-mediated corticotropin releasing hormone release. It has also been used as a lead compound to develop a number of newer more potent Y1 antagonists.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benocyclidine	Benocyclidine	123692			112726-66-6				Benocyclidine (BCP), or benzothiophenylcyclohexylpiperidine (BTCP), is a psychoactive drug and research chemical of the arylcyclohexylamine class. It acts as a potent and selective dopamine reuptake inhibitor (DRI) and a psychostimulant. Unlike related compounds like phencyclidine and ketamine, benocyclidine is a pure DRI with negligible affinity for the NMDA receptor, and it therefore lacks any anticonvulsant, anesthetic, hallucinogenic, or dissociative effects. It has been used to label the dopamine transporter. BCP was also used to try to find a common pharmacophore for DRI type stimulants. More recently, benocyclidine has been found in several ecstasy tablets, sold as MDMA.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Conolidine	Conolidine	51051652			100414-81-1				Conolidine is an alkaloid. Preliminary reports suggest that it could provide analgesic effects with few of the detrimental side-effects associated with opioids such as morphine, though at present it has only been evaluated in mouse models. Conolidine was first isolated in 2004, from the bark of the Tabernaemontana divaricata (Crepe jasmine) shrub which is used in traditional Chinese medicine. A method for creating synthetic conolidine from a commercially available acetyl-pyridine in 9 steps was developed by Micalizio, Bohn, and coworkers in 2011. This synthetic route allows access to either enantiomer (mirror image) of conolidine via an early enzymatic resolution. Notably, both enantiomers of the synthetic compound show analgesic effects.

Animal studies have shown it to possess antiinflammatory and anti-hyperalgesic effects at low doses, followed by ataxia and analgesic effects when the dose is increased. Selective CB2 agonist drugs such as GW-405,833 are hoped to be particularly useful in the treatment of allodynia and neuropathic pain for which current treatment options are often inadequate.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Iofetamine_(123I)	Iofetamine (123I)	156375			75917-92-9				Iofetamine (I) (INN; brand names Perfusamine, SPECTamine), or N-isopropyl-(I)-p-iodoamphetamine (IMP), is a lipid-soluble amine and radiopharmaceutical drug used in cerebral blood perfusion imaging with single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT). Labeled with the radioactive isotope iodine-123, it is approved for use in the United States as a diagnostic aid in determining the localization of and in the evaluation of non-lacunar stroke and complex partial seizures, as well as in the early diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. An analogue of amphetamine, iofetamine has shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine as well as induce the release of these neurotransmitters and of dopamine with similar potencies to other amphetamines like d-amphetamine and p-chloroamphetamine. In addition, on account of its high lipophilicity, iofetamine rapidly penetrates the blood-brain-barrier. Accordingly, though not known to have been reported in the medical literature, iofetamine likely possesses psychostimulant and possibly entactogenic effects. However, based on structure-activity relationships, it may also be highly neurotoxic to serotonergic and dopaminergic neurons similarly to most other para-halogenated amphetamines.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/L-368,899	L-368,899	132857			148927-60-0				L-368,899 is a drug used in scientific research which acts as a selective antagonist of the oxytocin receptor, with good selectivity over the related vasopressin receptors. Unlike related drugs such as the peripherally selective L-371,257, the oral bioavailabity is high and the brain penetration of L-368,899 is rapid, with selective accumulation in areas of the limbic system. This makes it a useful tool for investigating the centrally mediated roles of oxytocin, such as in social behaviour and pair bonding, and studies in primates have shown L-368,899 to reduce a number of behaviours such as food sharing, sexual activity and caring for infants, demonstrating the importance of oxytocinergic signalling in mediating these important social behaviours.

It has been suggested as a possible substitute drug for the treatment of cocaine addiction. ""RTI-113 has properties that make it an ideal medication for cocaine abusers, such as an equivalent efficacy, a higher potency, and a longer duration of action as compared to cocaine. "" Replacing the methyl ester in RTI-31 with a phenyl ester makes the resultant RTI-113 fully DAT specific. RTI-113 is a particularly relevant phenyltropane cocaine analog that has been tested on squirrel monkeys. RTI-113 has also been tested against cocaine in self-administration studies for DAT occupancy by PET on awake rhesus monkeys. The efficacy of cocaine analogs to elicit self administration is closely related to the rate at which they are administered. Slower onset of action analogs are less likely to function as positive reinforcers than analogues that have a faster rate of onset. In order for a DRI such as cocaine to induce euphoria PET scans on primates reveal that the DAT occupancy needs to be >60%. Limited reinforcement may be desirable because it can help with patient compliance. DAT occupancy was between 65-76% and 94-99% for doses of cocaine and RTI-113 that maintained maximum response rates, respectively. Whereas cocaine is a fast acting rapidly metabolized DRI, RTI-113 has a longer duration span. Self-administration graphs are inverted U-shaped. More doses of cocaine need to be administered per session than for RTI-113 because cocaine doesn't last as long as RTI-113 does. It is easy to form the rash judgement that the NRI and SRI properties of cocaine are somehow having an additive effect on provoking self-administration of cocaine. Although NRIs are known to inhibit DA reuptake in the prefrontal cortex where DATs are low in number, the fact that desipramine is not reliably self-administered makes it unlikely that NRIs are contributing to the addictive character of cocaine. The 5-HT receptors are very complex to understand and can either mediate or inhibit DA release. However, on the whole, it is understood that synaptic 5-HT counterbalances catecholamine release. Thus, it can said with relative certainty that the DAT is responsible for the bulk of the reinforcing effects of cocaine and related stimulants. With regard to amphetamine, a recent paper disputes this claim, and makes the point that the role of NE is completely underrated. Another paper was also recently published, seeking to address the relevance of NE in cocaine pharmacology."

First publicized in the 1990s, it has not been used enough to have gained a fully established profile. RTI-51 can be expected to have properties lying somewhere in between RTI-31 and RTI-55. Importantly it has a ratio of monoamine reuptake inhibition of D > S > N which is an unusual balance of effects not produced by other commonly used compounds (although RTI-121 is similar, but more DAT selective). It has been used in its Br radiolabelled form to map the distribution of dopamine transporters in the brain. Modern research seems to confirm the above hypothesis. However, earlier work produced more scattered results. Based upon what is obvious from the table, RTI-31, RTI-51, and RTI-55 are all similarly potent TRIs.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-Methoxytryptamine	5-Methoxytryptamine	1833			608-07-1				5-Methoxytryptamine (5-MT), also known as mexamine, is a tryptamine derivative closely related to the neurotransmitters serotonin and melatonin. 5-MT has been shown to occur naturally in the body in low levels. It is biosynthesized via the deacetylation of melatonin in the pineal gland. 5-MT acts as a full agonist at the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT4, 5-HT6, and 5-HT7 receptors. It has no affinity for the 5-HT3 receptor and it should also be noted that its affinity for the 5-HT1E receptor is very weak in comparison to the other 5-HT1 receptors. Its affinity for the 5-HT5A receptor is unknown.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/7-PET	7-PET	203125			13965-63-4				7-PET was discovered by K.W. Bentley and is a potent analgesic drug, 300 times the potency of morphine by weight. It is related to the more well-known oripavine derivative opioid etorphine, which is used as a very potent veterinary painkiller and anesthetic medication, used primarily for the sedation of large animals such as elephants, giraffes and rhinos. 7-PET itself has a 3-O-methyl ether which reduces potency, but the 3-OH derivative is around 2200x morphine, almost the same potency as etorphine as a Î¼ agonist, and unexpectedly the 3-desoxy compound is also around the same potency of 2000x morphine. Unlike etorphine however, 7-PET is not an illegal drug, and is not controlled under the UN drug conventions, but it might still be considered to be a controlled substance analogue of etorphine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the USA, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. 40px This analgesic-related article is a stub.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acetylmorphone	Acetylmorphone	625177			14696-22-1				Acetylmorphone (Dihydromorphinone acetate) is an opiate analogue that is an acetylated derivative of hydromorphone which was developed in the early 1900s as a potential cough suppressant and analgesic. It is prepared by the acetylation of hydromorphone using either acetyl chloride or acetic anhydride. It was banned internationally in 1930 by the Health Committee of the League of Nations, in order to prevent its sale as an analogue of heroin. Acetylmorphone is not currently used in medicine, but may have a higher bioavailability than hydromorphone due to its greater lipid solubility, and hence is likely to be more potent than the parent drug, although probably slower acting due to the requirement for deacetylation to the active metabolite hydromorphone. It can be expected to have similar side effects to other opiates, which would include itching, nausea and respiratory depression.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dipropanoylmorphine	Dipropanoylmorphine	165894			10589-79-4				Dipropanoylmorphine (Dipropionylmorphine in U.S. English) is an opiate derivative, the 3,6-dipropanoyl ester of morphine. It was developed in 1972 as an analgesic. It is rarely used in some countries for the relief of severe pain such as that caused by terminal cancer, as an alternative to diamorphine (heroin) and morphine. Dipropanoylmorphine, though rarely used, is considered to be a safer and less addictive alternative to morphine. Studies and clinical trials comparing dipropanoylmorphine to morphine have produced results that indicate the incidence of side-effects are far more common with morphine. Respiratory depression, euphoria, excessive sedation and somnolence (so-called 'nodding' by opiate abusers), constipation, miosis (pinpoint pupils), nausea, bradycardia, behavioral disturbances, and severe physical and psychological dependence on morphine is more likely with the use of morphine versus dipropanoylmorphine. Dipropanoylmorphine is slightly slower acting than diamorphine and morphine, but longer lasting, and is slightly more potent by weight due to its higher lipophilicity. Side effects are generally relatively mild for an opioid with a similar profile to morphine/heroin and typical of other opioids. The most common side effects associated with dipropanoylmorphine are itching, nausea and respiratory depression. Dipropanoylmorphine is prepared by reacting morphine with propionic anhydride, in an analogous manner to how heroin is produced by reacting morphine with acetic anhydride. While acetic anhydride is a restricted chemical around the world due to its potential uses in making heroin from morphine for the illicit market, it is used in vast amounts by the chemical industry for the manufacture of drugs such as aspirin. Propanoic anhydride however is much less widely used. Although it is used in the manufacture of a range of pharmaceuticals, none of these are produced in nearly as large quantities, and sales of propanoic anhydride in quantities larger than one gram must be reported in many countries because of its potential use in making fentanyl type synthetic opiates.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine	Dipropylcyclopentylxanthine	1329			102146-07-6				8-Cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX, PD-116,948) is a drug which acts as a potent and selective antagonist for the adenosine A1 receptor. It has high selectivity for A1 over other adenosine receptor subtypes, but as with other xanthine derivatives DPCPX also acts as a phosphodiesterase inhibitor, and is almost as potent as rolipram at inhibiting PDE4. It has been used to study the function of the adenosine A1 receptor in animals, which has been found to be involved in several important functions such as regulation of breathing and activity in various regions of the brain, and DPCPX has also been shown to produce behavioural effects such as increasing the hallucinogen-appropriate responding produced by the 5-HT2A agonist DOI, and the dopamine release induced by MDMA, as well as having interactions with a range of anticonvulsant drugs.

Unlike cholecystokin which has a variety of roles in the gastrointenstinal system as well as central nervous system effects, CCK-4 acts primarily in the brain as an anxiogenic, although it does retain some GI effects, but not as much as CCK-8 or the full length polypeptide CCK-58. CCK-4 reliably causes severe anxiety symptoms when administered to humans in a dose of as little as 50Î¼g, and is commonly used in scientific research to induce panic attacks for the purpose of testing new anxiolytic drugs. Since it is a peptide, CCK-4 must be administered by injection, and is rapidly broken down once inside the body so has only a short duration of action, although numerous synthetic analogues with modified properties are known.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ezetimibe/simvastatin	Ezetimibe/simvastatin				444313-53-5		Oral		"Ezetimibe/simvastatin is a drug combination used for the treatment of dyslipidemia. It is a combination of ezetimibe (best known as Zetia in the United States and Ezetrol elsewhere) and the statin drug simvastatin (best known as Zocor in the U.S.). The combination preparation is marketed by Merck & Co. /Schering-Plough Pharmaceuticals (joint venture) under the trade names Vytorin and Inegy. Ezetimibe reduces blood cholesterol by inhibiting absorption of cholesterol by the small intestine by acting at the brush border of the small intestine and inhibits the absorption of cholesterol, leading to a decrease in the delivery of intestinal cholesterol to the liver. Simvastatin is an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor or statin. It works by blocking an enzyme that is necessary for the body to make cholesterol. Even though ezetimibe decreases cholesterol levels, as of 2009 it has not been found to lead to improvement in real world outcomes. The combination of simvastatin and ezetimibe has not been found to be any better than simvastatin alone. A panel of experts thus concluded in 2008 that it should ""only be used as a last resort""."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pseudophenmetrazine	Pseudophenmetrazine				13580-23-9				Pseudophenmetrazine is a psychostimulant compound of the morpholine class. It is the N-demethylated and cis-configured analogue of phendimetrazine as well as the cis-configured stereoisomer of phenmetrazine. In addition, along with phenmetrazine, it is believed to be one of the active metabolites of phendimetrazine, which itself is inactive and behaves merely as a prodrug. Relative to phenmetrazine, pseudophenmetrazine is of fairly low potency, acting as a modest releasing agent of norepinephrine (EC50 = 514 nM), while, interestingly, its (+)-enantiomer is a weak releaser of dopamine (EC50 = 1,457 nM) whereas its (-)-enantiomer is a weak reuptake inhibitor of dopamine (Ki = 2,691 nM); together as a racemic mixture with the two enantiomers combined, pseudophenmetrazine behaves overall more as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor (Ki = 2,630 nM), possibly due to the (+)-enantiomer blocking the uptake of the (-)-enantiomer into dopaminergic neurons and thus preventing it from inducing dopamine release. Neither enantiomer has any significant effect on serotonin reuptake or release (both Ki = >10,000 nM and EC50 = >10,000 nM, respectively).

The affinity of larger 5-position substituted N,N-dialkyltryptamines at the 5-HT2 receptor subtypes has in most cases not been studied, but the widespread recreational use of N,N-dialkylated 5-methoxytryptamine derivatives including 5-MeO-DMT, 5-MeO-MiPT and 5-MeO-DiPT has led to concern that the 5-ethoxy homologues of these drugs could emerge as novel designer drugs, and consequently not only 5-EtO-DMT but also other derivatives including 5-EtO-DET, 5-EtO-DPT, 5-EtO-DiPT, 5-EtO-DALT, 5-EtO-MPT, 5-EtO-MiPT, 5-EtO-EiPT, 5-EtO-MET and 5-EtO-EPT, were synthesised as analytical standards in order to facilitate future research into these compounds.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anatabine	Anatabine				581-49-7				Anatabine (uh-nat-uh-been,-bin) is one of the minor alkaloids found in plants in the Solanaceae family, which includes the tobacco plant and tomato, that has been shown to affect monoamine oxidase (MAO) activity. Anatabine is found in cigarette tobacco and smoke, and is absorbed in the human body after tobacco use. There have been hypotheses that minor tobacco constituents and other non-nicotine therapies may be beneficial in fighting nicotine withdrawal. Many studies have been conducted investigating the effects of smoking on MAO activity. Anatabine is one of the ingredients in the smoking alternative dietary supplement, CiGRX, developed by Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals. The use of anatabine rather than nicotine replacement therapy is related to the half-lives of nicotine and anatabine. The latency of needing a cigarette (LTNC) among regular smokers was less than two hours compared to the half-life of anatabine which is 10 hours. Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals has also developed Anatabloc, a product that targets inflammation. The Roskamp Institute in Sarasota, Florida, has worked with Rock Creek Pharmaceuticals to study the effects of the anatabine compound on inflammatory diseases and disorders. Roskamp findings can be viewed at The Roskamp Institute Website. Anatabine's potential in fighting Alzheimer's disease and other inflammatory illnesses is being studied.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sodium_hyaluronate	Sodium hyaluronate				9067-32-7				Sodium hyaluronate is the sodium salt of hyaluronan. The name hyaluronic acid is derived from the Greek word ÏﾍÎ±Î»Î¿Ï‚ (hyalos) meaning vitreous, and uronic acid as it was first isolated from the vitreous humour in the eye and possesses a high uronic acid content. The term hyaluronate also refers to the conjugate base of hyaluronic acid. Because the molecule typically exists in vivo in its polyanionic form, it is most commonly referred to as hyaluronan. It is a visco-elastic polymer normally found in the aqueous and vitreous humour. Sodium hyaluronate is a viscous solution consisting of a high molecular weight fraction of purified natural sodium hyaluronate in buffered physiological sodium chloride. Hyaluronic acid is a natural complex sugar of the glycosaminoglycan family and is a long-chain polymer containing repeating disaccharide units of Na-glucuronate-N-acetylglucosamine. Sodium hyaluronate occurs naturally on the corneal endothelium, bound to specific receptors for which it has a high affinity.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Umirolimus	Umirolimus				851536-75-9				Umirolimus, is a macrocyclic lactone, a highly lipophilic derivative of sirolimus, an immunosuppressant. This drug is proprietary to Biosensors International, which uses it in its own drug-eluting stents, and licenses it to partners such as Terumo. Umirolimus inhibits T cell and smooth muscle cell proliferation, and was designed for use in drug eluting stents. This analog has a chemical modification at position 40 of the rapamycin ring. It has potent immunosuppressive properties that are similar to those of sirolimus, but the drug is more rapidly absorbed by the vessel wall, readily attaches and enters smooth muscle cell membranes causing cell cycle arrest at G0, and is comparable to sirolimus in terms of potency.

It is a so-called triple re/uptake inhibitor (TUI) or SNDRI. It is the (+)-enantiomer of DOV 216,303. IC50 values for SERT, NET, and DAT are Ki 99 nM, 262 nM, and 213 nM. The IC50 values for serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine uptake are 12, 23 and 96 nM, respectively Amitifadine reduces the duration of immobility in the forced swim test in rats with an oral minimum effective dose (MED) of 5Â mg/kg. This anti-depressant-like effect manifests in the absence of significant increases in motor activity at doses of up to 20Â mg/kg. Amitifadine also produces a dose-dependent reduction in immobility in the tail suspension test, with an oral MED of 5Â mg/kg. In microdialysis studies, amitifadine increased extracellular levels of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in brain regions and did not induce hyperactivity in rats. Results in a small clinical trial indicated that amitifadine had statistically significant antidepressant effects and was well tolerated.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/S32212	S32212	11384503							S32212 is a drug which is currently under preclinical investigation as a potential antidepressant medicine. It behaves as a selective, combined 5-HT2C receptor inverse agonist and Î±2-adrenergic receptor antagonist with additional 5-HT2A and, to a lesser extent, 5-HT2B receptor antagonistic properties, and lacks any apparent affinity for the monoamine reuptake transporters or for the Î±1-adrenergic, H1, or mACh receptors. This profile of activity is compatible with the definition of a noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant (NaSSA), and as such, S32212 could in turn be classified as a NaSSA if it reaches the market. In animal studies, S32212 raised BDNF concentrations in the hippocampus and amygdala, increased the firing rate of neurons in the adrenergic perikarya in the locus coeruleus, increased levels of norepinephrine in the frontal cortex and hippocampus, and elevated frontal cortex levels of dopamine and acetylcholine, though not of serotonin or histamine. It produces effects indicative of antidepressant, anxiolytic, antiobsessional, antiaggressive, and cognitive- and sleep-enhancing properties in animal models, all while not perturbing body weight or sexual behavior.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Fluoropethidine	4-Fluoropethidine	11184669							4-Fluoropethidine is a drug that is a derivative of pethidine (meperidine), which combines pethidine's opioid analgesic effects with increased monoamine reuptake inhibition. It is around 50% less potent than pethidine as an opioid analgesic, but conversely is 50% more potent as a dopamine reuptake inhibitor, with other derivatives such as the 4-iodo and 3,4-dichloro analogues being even more potent dopamine reuptake inhibitors again. However none of these compounds substitute for cocaine or produce stimulant effects in animals, suggesting that they still act primarily as opioid analgesic drugs in practice.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Librax	Librax	3080646							Librax is a drug consisting of chlordiazepoxide and clidinium bromide and used to treat peptic ulcers, irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and gastritis. It helps relieve stomach spasms, abdominal cramps, and anxiety related to gastric disorders. Librax is a fixed ratio of these two medications and, as such, is not typically prescribed with an accompanying dosage, but rather how many capsules per day are to be taken. It comes as a capsule to be taken by mouth and is usually taken three or four times a day, before meals and at bedtime. Chlordiazepoxide is an anti-anxiety medication belonging to the benzodiazepine class. Its use in IBS is thought to be due to its calming ability for patients that have IBS symptoms that are worsened by anxiety. Clidinium bromide is a synthetic quaternary ammonium antimuscarinic, a sub-class of a family of drugs known as anticholinergics. It works in IBS by decreasing gastrointestinal motility. Chlordiazepoxide can be habit-forming. Tolerance may develop with long-term or excessive use, making this medication less effective. This medication must be taken regularly to be effective. Stopping the drug suddenly can worsen the condition and cause withdrawal symptoms (anxiousness, sleeplessness, and irritability).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/2-Methoxyethyl-18-methoxycoronaridinate	2-Methoxyethyl-18-methoxycoronaridinate	10070278							(â€“)-2-Methoxyethyl-18-methoxycoronaridinate (ME-18-MC) is a second generation synthetic derivative of ibogaine developed by the research team led by the pharmacologist Stanley D. Glick from the Albany Medical College and the chemist Martin E. Kuehne from the University of Vermont. In animal studies it has shown similar efficacy to the related compound 18-methoxycoronaridine (18-MC) at reducing self-administration of morphine and methamphetamine but with higher potency by weight, showing anti-addictive effects at the equivalent of half the minimum effective dose of 18-MC. Similarly to 18-MC itself, ME-18-MC acts primarily as a selective Î±3Î²4 nicotinic acetylcholine antagonist, although it has a slightly stronger effect than 18-MC as an NMDA antagonist, and its effects on opioid receptors are weaker than those of 18-MC at all except the kappa opioid receptor, at which it has slightly higher affinity than 18-MC.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4'-Methyl-%CE%B1-pyrrolidinohexiophenone	4'-Methyl-Î±-pyrrolidinohexiophenone	6423085							4'-Methyl-Î±-pyrrolidinohexiophenone or MPHP is a stimulant compound which has been reported as a novel designer drug. It is closely related to pyrovalerone, being simply its chain-lengthened homologue.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/DASB	DASB	10446567							DASB is a compound that binds to the serotonin transporter. Labeled with carbon-11 â€” a radioactive isotope â€” it has been used as a radioligand in neuroimaging with positron emission tomography (PET) since around year 2000. In this context it is regarded as one of the superior radioligands for PET study of the serotonin transporter in the brain, since it has high selectivity for the serotonin transporter. The DASB image from a human PET scan shows high binding in the midbrain, thalamus and striatum, moderate binding in the medial temporal lobe and anterior cingulate, and low binding in neocortex. The cerebellum is often regarded as a region with no specific serotonin transporter binding and the brain region is used as a reference in some studies. Since the serotonin transporter is the target of SSRIs used in the treatment of major depression it has been natural to examine DASB binding in depressed patients. Several such research studies have been performed. There are a number of alternative PET radioligands for imaging the serotonin transporter: [C]ADAM, [C]AFM, [C]DAPA, [C]McN5652, and [C]-NS 4194. A related molecule to DASB, that can be labeled with fluorine-18, has also been suggested as a PET radioligand. With single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) using the radioisotope iodine-123 there are further radioligands available: [I]ODAM, [I]IDAM, [I]ADAM, and [I]Î²-CIT. A few studies have examined the difference in binding between the radioligands in nonhuman primates, as well as in pigs. Other compounds that can be labeled to work as PET radioligands for the study of the serotonin system are, e.g. , altanserin and WAY-100635.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/EMDT	EMDT	6918513							2-Ethyl-5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (EMDT) is a tryptamine derivative which is used in scientific research.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pneumococcal_polysaccharide_vaccine	Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine						IM		Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) â€” the latest version is known as Pneumovax 23 (PPV-23) â€” is the first pneumococcal vaccine, the first vaccine derived from a capsular polysaccharide, and an important landmark in medical history. The polysaccharide antigens were used to induce type-specific antibodies that enhanced opsonization, phagocytosis, and killing of pneumococci by phagocytic cells. The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is widely used in high-risk adults. As a result, there have been important reductions in the incidence, morbidity, and mortality from pneumococcal pneumoniae and invasive pneumococcal disease. First used in 1945, the tetravalent vaccine was not widely distributed, since its deployment coincided with the discovery of penicillin. In the 1970s, Robert Austrian championed the manufacture and distribution of a 14-valent PPSV. This evolved in 1983 to a 23-valent formulation (PPSV23). A significant breakthrough impacting the burden of pneumococcal disease was the licensing of a protein conjugate heptavalent vaccine (PCV7) beginning in February 2000.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/U0126	U0126								U0126, is a highly selective inhibitor of both MEK1 and MEK2, a type of MAPK/ERK kinase. U0126 was found to functionally antagonize AP-1 transcriptional activity via noncompetitive inhibition of the dual specificity kinase MEK with IC50 of 72 nM for MEK1 and 58 nM for MEK2. U0126 inhibited anchorage-independent growth of Ki-ras-transformed rat fibroblasts by simultaneously blocking both extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)-p70(S6K) pathways. The effects of U0126 on the growth of eight human breast cancer cell lines shown that U0126 selectively repressed anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB231 and HBC4 cells, two lines with constitutively activated ERK. Loss of contact with substratum triggers apoptosis in many normal cell types, a phenomenon termed anoikis. U0126 sensitized MDA-MB231 and HBC4 to anoikis, i.e. , upon treatment with U0126, cells deprived of anchorage entered apoptosis. U0126 is also a weak inhibitor of PKC, Raf, ERK, JNK, MEKK, MKK-3, MKK-4/SEK, MKK-6, Cdk2 and Cdk4

MDMA has become widely known as ""ecstasy"" (shortened to ""E"", ""X"", or ""XTC""), usually referring to its street pill form, although this term may also include the presence of possible adulterants. The term ""molly"" or ""mandy"" colloquially refers to MDMA in powder or crystalline form, usually implying a higher level of purity. MDMA can induce euphoria, a sense of intimacy with others, and diminished anxiety. Many studies, particularly in the fields of psychology and cognitive therapy, have suggested that MDMA has therapeutic benefits and facilitates therapy sessions in certain individuals, a practice for which it had formally been used in the past. Clinical trials are now testing the therapeutic potential of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety associated with terminal cancer. MDMA is criminalized in most countries (though some civil society initiativesâ€”such as the Global Commission on Drug Policyâ€”consider educating the public about the drug more important than curtailing supply) and its possession, manufacture, or sale may result in criminal prosecution. Some limited exceptions exist for scientific and medical research. For 2008 the UN estimated between 10â€“25 million people globally used MDMA at least once in the past year. This was broadly similar to the number of cocaine, amphetamine and opioid users, but far fewer than the global number of cannabis users. It is taken in a variety of contexts far removed from its roots in psychotherapeutic settings and is commonly associated with dance parties and electronic dance music. Regulatory authorities in several locations around the world have approved scientific studies administering MDMA to humans to examine its therapeutic potential and its effects."

Synthesized originally as a cancer drug and a pro-drug for mercaptopurine in 1957, it has been widely used as a immunosuppressant for more than 50 years. Azathioprine acts as a pro-drug for mercaptopurine, inhibiting an enzyme that is required for the synthesis of DNA. Thus it most strongly affects proliferating cells, such as the T cells and B cells of the immune system. The main adverse effect of azathioprine is bone marrow suppression, which can be life-threatening, especially in people with a genetic deficiency of the enzyme thiopurine S-methyltransferase. It is also listed by the International Agency for Research on Cancer as a Group 1 carcinogen (carcinogenic to humans). Azathioprine is produced by a number of manufacturers under different brand names (Azasan by Salix in the U.S. , Imuran by GlaxoSmithKline in Canada, the U.S. , Australia, Ireland and Great Britain, Azamun in Finland and Imurel in Scandinavia and France, among others).

Azithromycin is used to treat or prevent certain bacterial infections, most often those causing middle ear infections, strep throat, pneumonia, typhoid, bronchitis and sinusitis. In recent years, it has been used primarily to prevent bacterial infections in infants and those with weaker immune systems. It is also effective against certain sexually transmitted infections, such as nongonococcal urethritis, chlamydia, and cervicitis. Recent studies have indicated it also to be effective against late-onset asthma, but these findings are controversial and not widely accepted.

It is a prodrug of the free form, beclometasone (INN). In the form of an inhaler (e.g. Clenil, Qvar), a wide number of brands of which are available, it is used for the prophylaxis of asthma. As a nasal spray (e.g. Beconase, alanase, Vancenase), it is used for the treatment of rhinitis and sinusitis. In some instances, it is used by oral pathologists in the treatment of unusually severe aphthous ulcers. As a cream or ointment (trade name Propaderm), it is used to treat severe inflammatory skin disorders unresponsive to less potent steroids, but is generally avoided in the treatment of psoriasis due to the risk of rebound on withdrawal. It is also licensed to treat ulcerative colitis in conjunction with doses of 5-aminosalicylates in the United Kingdom in the form of a gastric acid-resistant, periodic release tablet marketed under the brand name Clipper.

It is readily available over the counter and is indicated for the treatment of the symptoms of the common cold and allergic rhinitis, such as runny nose, itchy eyes, watery eyes, and sneezing. It is a first-generation antihistamine. Brompheniramine is part of a series of antihistamines including pheniramine (Naphcon) and its halogenated derivatives and others including fluorpheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dexchlorpheniramine (Polaramine), deschlorpheniramine, dipheniramine (also known as triprolidine with the trade name Actifed), and iodopheniramine. The halogenated alkylamine antihistamines all exhibit optical isomerism and brompheniramine products contain racemic brompheniramine maleate whereas dexbrompheniramine (Drixoral) is the dextrorotary (right-handed) stereoisomer. Brompheniramine has antidepressant properties, inhibiting reuptake of the neurotransmitter serotonin. Based on this knowledge, Arvid Carlsson and his colleagues, working at the Swedish company Astra AB, were able to derive the first marketed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, zimelidine, from brompheniramine. Like other agents of this type, brompheniramine also has analgesic-sparing (potentiating) effects on opioid analgesics, commonly reducing codeine, dihydrocodeine, and hydrocodone requirements by 10 to 35 percent.

It is considered a prototypical broad-spectrum antibiotic, alongside the tetracyclines, and as it is both cheap and easy to manufacture it is frequently an antibiotic of choice in the Developing World. Chloramphenicol, also known as chlornitromycin, is effective against a wide variety of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including most anaerobic organisms. Due to resistance and safety concerns, it is no longer a first-line agent for any infection in developed nations, with the notable exception of topical treatment of bacterial conjunctivitis. Nevertheless, the global problem of advancing bacterial resistance to newer drugs has led to renewed interest in its use. In low-income countries, chloramphenicol is still widely used because it is inexpensive and readily available. The most serious adverse effect associated with chloramphenicol treatment is bone marrow toxicity, which may occur in two distinct forms: bone marrow suppression, which is a direct toxic effect of the drug and is usually reversible, and aplastic anemia, which is idiosyncratic (rare, unpredictable, and unrelated to dose) and generally fatal.

The recommended dosage is 400Â mg, three times a day. Although delavirdine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1997, its efficacy is lower than other NNRTIs, especially efavirenz, and it also has an inconvenient schedule. These factors have led the U.S. DHHS not to recommend its use as part of initial therapy. The risk of cross-resistance across the NNRTI class, as well as its complex set of drug interactions, make the place of delavirdine in second-line and salvage therapy unclear, and it is currently rarely used.

It inhibits the reuptake of norepinephrine and to a lesser extent serotonin. It is used to treat depression, but not considered a first line treatment since the introduction of SSRI antidepressants. Desipramine is an active metabolite of imipramine. It is sold under the brand names Norpramin and Pertofrane. Along with other tricyclics, desipramine has found use in treating neuropathic pain. The mechanism of action seems to involve the activation, through norepinephrine reuptake inhibition, of descending pathways in the spinal cord that block pain signals from ascending to the brain. Desipramine is one of the most potent and selective medications in this respect. It may also be used to treat symptoms of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, as the underproduction of norepinephrine has been increasingly linked to symptoms associated with Attention Deficit Disorder. It may also be used to treat symptoms of cocaine withdrawal.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cyclopentolate	Cyclopentolate	2905	DB00979	I76F4SHP7J	512-15-2		Topic		Cyclopentolate is a medication commonly used during pediatric eye examinations that dilates the eye, prevents accommodation of the eye to different distances, and blocks specific receptors called muscarinic receptors. Cyclopentolate is also administered as an atropine substitute to reverse muscarinic and central nervous system effects of indirect cholinomimetic (anti-AChase) administration. When used in eye drops in pediatric eye examinations, Cyclopentolate 0.5 percent and 1.0 percent is used to stop the eye focusing at near distance, enabling the ophthalmologist, optometrist, or orthoptist to obtain a more accurate reading of the focusing power of the eyes. Brand names include Cyclogyl, Cylate, & Pentolair. The drops take around 30-60 minutes to work and less than 24 hours to wear off (with patients advised not to drive a vehicle or operate machinery for the first 12 hours). The pupils become wider when Cyclopentolate is administered, making the eyes more sensitive to light. Close objects (and possibly distant objects) will also appear blurred. Side effects to Cyclopentolate are rare, but can include effects such as disorientation, incoherent speech or visual disturbances during the 24-hour period that the drug has an effect. The side effects are more common in children.

A single amino acid has been slightly changed in its molecular structure. This change helps the fast-acting insulin analog absorb quickly into the bloodstream. As a result, it starts working in minutes, which allows you to take insulin and eat right away. Fast-acting insulin analogs are considered to act similar to the way insulin is released in people without diabetes mellitus. Novolog allows for a flexible dosing schedule, which allows the patient to adjust their insulin according to any changes in their eating habits. The safety and efficacy of Insulin aspart (NovoLog/NovoRapid) in real life clinical practice was evaluated in the A1chieve study. It was created through recombinant DNA technology so that the amino acid, B28, which is normally proline, is substituted with an aspartic acid residue. This analogue has increased charge repulsion, which prevents the formation of hexamers, to create a faster acting insulin. The sequence was inserted into the yeast genome, and the yeast expressed the insulin analogue, which was then harvested from a bioreactor. According to JDRF, insulin aspart was approved for marketing in the United States by the Food and Drug Administration in June 2000."

It was first approved for use in the United States in 1996, making it the first insulin analogue to enter the market. Engineered through recombinant DNA technology, the penultimate lysine and proline residues on the C-terminal end of the B-chain are reversed. This modification does not alter receptor binding, but blocks the formation of insulin dimers and hexamers. This allowed larger amounts of active monomeric insulin to be immediately available for postprandial injections. Insulin lispro has one primary advantage over regular insulin for postprandial glucose control. It has a shortened delay of onset, allowing slightly more flexibility than regular insulin, which requires a longer waiting period before starting a meal after injection. Both preparations should be coupled with a longer acting insulin for good glycemic control."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Natalizumab	Natalizumab		DB00108	3JB47N2Q2P	189261-10-7		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		Natalizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody against the cell adhesion molecule Î±4-integrin. Natalizumab is used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis and Crohn's disease. It is co-marketed by Biogen Idec and Ã‰lan as Tysabri, and was previously named Antegren. Natalizumab is administered by intravenous infusion every 28 days. The drug is believed to work by reducing the ability of inflammatory immune cells to attach to and pass through the cell layers lining the intestines and bloodâ€“brain barrier. Natalizumab has proven effective in treating the symptoms of both diseases, preventing relapse, vision loss, cognitive decline and significantly improving quality of life in people with multiple sclerosis, as well as increasing rates of remission and preventing relapse in Crohn's disease. Natalizumab was approved in 2004 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It was subsequently withdrawn from the market by its manufacturer after it was linked with three cases of the rare neurological condition progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) when administered in combination with interferon beta-1a, another immunosuppressive drug often used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis. After a review of safety information and no further deaths, the drug was returned to the US market in 2006 under a special prescription program. As of June 2009, ten cases of PML were known. However, twenty-four cases of PML had been reported since its reintroduction by October 2009, showing a sharp rise in the number of fatalities and prompting a review of the chemical for human use by the European Medicines Agency. By January 2010, 31 cases of PML were attributed to natalizumab. The FDA did not withdraw the drug from the market because its clinical benefits outweigh the risks involved. In the European Union, it has been approved for human use only for the treatment of multiple sclerosis and only then as a monotherapy because the initial cases of PML, and later the fatalities, were said by the manufacturers to be linked to the use of previous medicines by the patients. Biogen Idec announced the initiation of the first clinical trial of natalizumab as a potential cancer treatment as of September 5, 2008.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tositumomab	Tositumomab		DB00081	0343IGH41U	192391-48-3				Tositumomab is a drug for the treatment of follicular lymphoma. It is an IgG2a anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody derived from immortalized mouse cells. Tositumomab is applied in a sequential infusion followed by iodine (I) tositumomab, which is the same antibody covalently bound to the radionuclide iodine-131 (I). I emits both beta and gamma radiation and decays with a half-life of 8 days. Clinical trials have established the efficacy of the tositumomab/iodine (I) tositumomab regimen in patients with relapsed or chemotherapy/rituxan refractory follicular lymphoma. This drug combination is manufactured by Corixa. It sells in the U.S. under the trade name Bexxar. Bexxar was developed by Dr. Mark Kaminski and Dr. Richard Wahl.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basiliximab	Basiliximab		DB00074	9927MT646M	152923-56-3				Basiliximab (trade name Simulect) is a chimeric mouse-human monoclonal antibody to the Î± chain of the IL-2 receptor of T cells. It is used to prevent rejection in organ transplantation, especially in kidney transplants. It is a Novartis Pharmaceuticals product and was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1998. It is a chimeric CD25 monoclonal antibody of the IgG1 isotype. It acts as an antagonist at the interleukin-2(IL-2) binding site of the p55 subunit (Tac antigen) of the high affinity IL-2 receptor (CD25) on the surface of the activated T lymphocytes. Minimum serum level should be 0.2Â ug/ml(ELISA) Dose is 20Â mg two times 4 days apart generally in an adult. It is given in two doses, the first within 2 hours of the start of the transplant operation and the second 4 days after the transplant. These saturate the receptors and prevent T cells from replication and also from activating the B cells, which are responsible for the production of antibodies, which would bind to the transplanted organ and stimulate an immune response against the transplant. Like the similar drug daclizumab, basiliximab reduces the incidence and severity of acute rejection in kidney transplantation without increasing the incidence of opportunistic infections. In the United Kingdom, the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has recommended its use be considered for all kidney transplant recipients. It has been reported that some cases of Lichen Planus have been successfully treated with Basiliximab as an alternative therapy to Cyclosporine, with a dose of 20Â mg every 4 days. No short-term side effects have been reported

Enrofloxacin is currently FDA-approved for treatment of individual pets and domestic animals in the United States. In September 2005, the FDA withdrew approval of Baytril for use in water to treat flocks of poultry, as this practice was noted to promote the evolution of fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of the bacterium Campylobacter, a human pathogen. Fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin are widely used in the treatment of human disease. It is a bactericidal agent. The bactericidal activity of enrofloxacin is concentration-dependent, with susceptible bacteria cell death occurring within 20â€“30 minutes of exposure.

It is a strong opioid agonist analgesic two to three times as potent as morphine with a side effect profile similar to that of dihydromorphine, morphine, and diamorphine. Nicomorphine was patented as Vilan by Lannacher Heilmittel Ges. m.b.H. of Austria in 1957 and was first synthesized in 1904 either there or at another firm in what was then Austria-Hungary. The hydrochloride salt is available as ampoules of 10Â mg/ml solution for injection, 5Â mg tablets, and 10Â mg suppositories. It is possible that other manufacturers distribute 10Â mg tablets and other concentrations of injectable nicomorphine in ampoules and multidose vials. It is used, particularly in the German-speaking countries and elsewhere in Central Europe and some other countries in Europe and the former USSR in particular, for post-operative, cancer, chronic non-malignant and other neuropathic pain. It is commonly used in patient-controlled analgesia (PCA) units. The usual starting dose is 5â€“10Â mg given every 3â€“5 hours. The 3,6-diesters of morphine are drugs with more rapid and complete central nervous system penetration due to increased lipid solubility and other structural considerations. The prototype for this subgroup of semi-synthetic opiates is heroin and the group also includes dipropanoylmorphine, diacetyldihydromorphine, disalicylmorphine and others. Whilst this produces an enhanced ""bang"" when the drug is administered intravenously, it cannot be distinguished from morphine via other routes, although the different side effect profile, including lower incidence of nausea, is very apparent."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pexacerfont	Pexacerfont	?		LF1VBG4ZUK	459856-18-9		Oral		Pexacerfont (BMS-562,086) is a drug developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb which acts as a CRF-1 antagonist. Corticotropin releasing factor (CRF), also known as Corticotropin releasing hormone, is an endogenous peptide hormone which is released in response to various triggers such as chronic stress. This then triggers the release of corticotropin (ACTH), another hormone which is involved in the physiological response to stress. Chronic release of CRF and ACTH is believed to be directly or indirectly involved in many of the harmful physiological effects of chronic stress, such as excessive glucocorticoid release, diabetes mellitus, osteoporosis, stomach ulcers, anxiety, depression, and development of high blood pressure and consequent cardiovascular problems. Pexacerfont is a recently developed CRF-1 antagonist which is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of anxiety disorders, and has also been proposed to be useful for the treatment of depression and irritable bowel syndrome. A recent multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial found that Pexacerfont (100 mg/day) did not separate from placebo on the primary outcome measure (the mean change from baseline to end point in the Hamilton Anxiety Scale score). These results suggest that blockade of CRF-1 receptor may not be a feasible treatment for anxiety disorders in certain human populations.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aclidinium_bromide	Aclidinium bromide	11519741		UQW7UF9N91	320345-99-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inhalation		Aclidinium bromide (INN, marketed under the brand name Tudorza Pressair in the US, Eklira Genuair in the UK; licensed to Menarini under the brand name Bretaris Genuair for majority of EU member states) is a long-acting, inhaled muscarinic antagonist approved in the US on July 24, 2012 as a maintenance treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Preclinically, aclidinium showed potent antagonism of human muscarinic receptors, with a long residence time at M3 receptors and a shorter residence time at M2 receptors, indicating the potential to provide sustained bronchodilation. Aclidinium is rapidly hydrolysed in human plasma, unlike other currently available antimuscarinics including tiotropium. This results in very low and transient systemic exposure, suggesting a reduced potential for class-related systemic side effects in the clinical setting. Early clinical studies in healthy subjects have confirmed the low systemic bioavailability and favourable safety profile of single and multiple doses of aclidinium. In a subsequent Phase IIb study, which included 464 patients with moderate to severe COPD, aclidinium displayed long-lasting bronchodilatory activity and was well tolerated. Aclidinium is delivered via a novel, multidose dry powder inhaler, the Genuair inhaler.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Methylnaltrexone	Methylnaltrexone	5361918		0RK7M7IABE	83387-25-1		Oral, intravenous, subcutaneous		Methylnaltrexone (MNTX, trade name Relistor) is one of the newer agents of peripherally-acting Î¼-opioid antagonists that act to reverse some of the side effects of opioid drugs such as constipation without affecting analgesia or precipitating withdrawals. Because it contains a permanently charged tetravalent nitrogen atom, it cannot cross the bloodâ€“brain barrier, and so has antagonist effects throughout the body, counteracting effects such as itching and constipation, but without affecting opioid effects in the brain such as analgesia. However, since a significant fraction (up to 60%) of opioid analgesia can be mediated by opioid receptors on peripheral sensory neurons, particularly in inflammatory conditions such as arthritis, traumatic or surgical pain, MNTX may increase pain under such circumstances.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Benactyzine	Benactyzine	9330		595EG71R3F	302-40-9		Oral		Benactyzine (Suavitil, Phebex, Phobex, Cedad, Cevanol, Deprol, Lucidil, Morcain, Nutinal, Parasan) is an anticholinergic drug used as an antidepressant in the treatment of depression and associated anxiety. However, its use for these indications is limited by side effects such as dry mouth and nausea, and at high doses it can cause more severe symptoms such as deliriant and hallucinogenic effects. Consequently, it is no longer widely used in medicine, although it is still a useful drug for scientific research. It does not possess any antihistamine properties.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blonanserin	Blonanserin	125564		AQ316B4F8C	132810-10-7		Oral		Blonanserin (Lonasen) is a relatively new atypical antipsychotic commercialized by Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma in Japan and Korea for the treatment of schizophrenia. Relative to many other antipsychotics, blonanserin has an improved tolerability profile, lacking side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms, excessive sedation, or hypotension. Blonanserin acts as a mixed 5-HT2 (Ki = 3.98 nM) and D2 receptor (Ki = 14.8 nM) antagonist and also exerts some blockade of Î±1-adrenergic receptors (Ki = 56.3 nM). It lacks significant affinity for numerous other sites including the 5-HT1A, 5-HT3, D1, Î±2-adrenergic, Î²-adrenergic, H1, and mACh receptors and the monoamine transporters, though it does possess low affinity for the sigma receptor (IC50 = 286 nM).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eptapirone	Eptapirone	208928		3M824XRO8N	179756-85-5		Oral		Eptapirone (F-11,440) is a very potent and highly selective 5-HT1A receptor full agonist of the azapirone class. Its affinity for the 5-HT1A receptor is 4.8 nM (Ki) or 8.33 (pKi), and its intrinsic activity is 100% or equal to that of serotonin. Eptapirone and its relatives such as F-13,640 and F-15,599 were developed under the notion that high receptor-activating efficacy is required for the maximal therapeutic benefits of 5-HT1A receptor agonists to be realized, underlying the poor clinical effectiveness of currently marketed agents like buspirone and tandospirone which act as mere weak-moderate partial agonists.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fluprazine	Fluprazine	71153		713BBL6840	76716-60-4		Oral		Fluprazine (DU-27,716) is a drug of the phenylpiperazine class. It is a so-called serenic or antiaggressive agent. It is closely related to several other piperazines, including eltoprazine and batoprazine, and TFMPP, as well as more distantly to the azapirones such as buspirone. The pharmacology of fluprazine is unknown, but it is likely to act as an agonist at the 5-HT1A and 5-HT1B receptors like its sister compound eltoprazine.

Research is continuing in both Russia and western nations into potential applications as a neuroprotective drug to combat Alzheimer's disease and, possibly, as a nootropic, as well. However, a phase III clinical trial for Alzheimer's disease (AD) treatment failed to show any benefit. Three other AD trials continue. Dimebon failed in the phase III trial for Huntington disease.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Olaparib	Olaparib	23725625		WOH1JD9AR8	763113-22-0		Oral		Olaparib (AZD-2281) is a experimental chemotherapeutic agent, developed by KuDOS Pharmaceuticals and later by Astra Zeneca, that failed to progress through clinical trials to approval. It is an inhibitor of poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), an enzyme involved in DNA repair. It acts against cancers in people with hereditary BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, which includes many ovarian, breast and prostate cancers. Early Phase I trials were promising, and olaparib underwent Phase II trials. However, in December 2011, AstraZeneca announced following interim analysis of a phase-II study which indicated that the previously reported progression free survival benefit was unlikely to translate into an overall survival benefit, that it would not progress into Phase III development for the maintenance treatment of serous ovarian cancer, and took a charge of $285 million.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pardoprunox	Pardoprunox	6918524		5R72CHP32S	269718-84-5		Oral		Pardoprunox (SLV-308) is an antiparkinsonian drug currently under development by Solvay for the treatment of Parkinson's disease and as of March 2010 is in Phase III clinical trials. It was also being investigated for the treatment of depression and anxiety but these indications appear to have been abandoned. Pardoprunox acts as a D2 (pKi = 8.1) and D3 receptor (pKi = 8.6) partial agonist (IA = 50% and 67%, respectively) and 5-HT1A receptor (pKi = 8.5) full agonist (IA = 100%). It also binds to D4 (pKi = 7.8), Î±1-adrenergic (pKi = 7.8), Î±2-adrenergic (pKi = 7.4), and 5-HT7 receptors (pKi = 7.2) with lower affinity. Relative to other dopaminergic antiparkinsonian agents, pardoprunox is thought to have significantly less of a propensity for inducing certain side effects like dyskinesia and psychosis.

Pomalidomide was approved on February 8, 2013 by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a treatment for relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. An application for approval to treat multiple myeloma also has been submitted by Celgene to the European Medicines Agency, and a decision on that application is expected by the second half of 2013.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sonepiprazole	Sonepiprazole	133079		O609V24217	170858-34-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		Sonepiprazole (U-101,387, PNU-101,387-G) is a drug of the phenylpiperazine class which acts as a highly selective D4 receptor antagonist. In animals, unlike D2 receptor antagonists like haloperidol, sonepiprazole does not block the behavioral effects of amphetamine or apomorphine, does not alter spontaneous locomotor activity on its own, and lacks extrapyramidal and neuroendocrine effects. However, it does reverse the prepulse inhibition deficits induced by apomorphine, and has also been shown to enhance cortical activity and inhibit stress-induced cognitive impairment. As a result, it was investigated as an antipsychotic for the treatment of schizophrenia in a placebo-controlled clinical trial, but in contrast to its comparator olanzapine no benefits were found and it was not researched further for this indication.

It produces maximal hyperemia quickly and maintains it for an optimal duration that is practical for radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging. It was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration on April 10, 2008 and is marketed by Astellas Pharma under the tradename Lexiscan. It has now gained approval in the European Union and is being sold under the name of Rapiscan. It is currently being marketed by GE Healthcare and is being sold in both the United Kingdom and Germany. Regadenoson has a 2- to 3-minute biological half-life, as compared with adenosine's 30-second half-life. Regadenoson stress protocols using a single bolus have been developed, obviating the need for an intravenous line. Regadenoson stress tests are not affected by the presence of beta blockers, as regadenoson vasodilates but does not stimulate beta adrenergic receptors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Azacyclonol	Azacyclonol	15723		2MMR990PEM	115-46-8		Oral		Azacyclonol (trade names Ataractan, Calmeran, Frenoton, Frenquel, Psychosan), also known as Î³-pipradol, is a drug which is a so-called ataractive, or agent which diminishes hallucinations in psychotic individuals. It has also been called a tranquilizer and antipsychotic, though these definitions are not accurate as it does not actually possess such properties. Despite being a positional isomer of pipradrol, it is not a psychostimulant, and instead has mild depressant effects. The drug was introduced in Europe in the mid-1950s for the treatment of schizophrenia likely on account of the fact that it was found to attenuate the subjective psychedelic effects of LSD and mescaline in humans. However, due to poor and mixed clinical effectiveness it never gained widespread acceptance and was eventually discontinued. The antihistamine agent terfenadine produces azacyclonol as an active major metabolite.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aloin	Aloin	313325		W41H6S09F4	8015-61-0		Oral		Aloin, also known as Barbaloin, is a bitter, yellow-brown colored compound noted in the exudate of at least 68 Aloe species at levels from 0.1 to 6.6% of leaf dry weight (making between 3% and 35% of the toal exudate) (Groom & Reynolds, 1987), and in another 17 species at indeterminate levels [Reynolds, 1995b]. It is used as a stimulant-laxative, treating constipation by inducing bowel movements. The compound is present in what is commonly referred to as the aloe latex that exudes from cells adjacent to the vascular bundles, found under the rind of the leaf and in between it and the gel. When dried, it has been used as a bittering agent in commerce (alcoholic beverages) [21 CFR 172.510. Scientific names given include Aloe perryi, A. barbadensis (= A. vera), A. ferox, and hybrids of A. ferox with A. africana and A. spicata.]. Aloe is listed in federal regulations as a natural substance that may be â€œsafely used in foodâ€ﾝ when used â€œin the minimum quantity required to produce their intended physical or technical effect and in accordance with all the principles of good manufacturing practice. â€ﾝ This food application is generally limited to use in quite small quantities as a flavoring in alcoholic beverages and may usually be identified only as a â€œnatural flavor. â€ﾝ In May 2002, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a ruling that aloe laxatives are no longer generally recognized as safe (GRAS) and effective, meaning that aloin-containing products are no longer available in over-the-counter drug products in the United States, because they may be carcinogenic and more data is needed to establish otherwise. Aloe vera leaf latex is a concentrate of an herb or other botanical, and so meets the statutory description of an ingredient that may be used in dietary supplements.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butriptyline	Butriptyline	21772		Z22441975X	35941-65-2		Oral		Butriptyline (Evadene, Evadyne, Evasidol, Centrolese) is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) which has been used in Europe since 1974. It is the isobutyl side chain homologue of amitriptyline and produces similar effects to it, but with less marked side effects like sedation and interactions with adrenergic drugs. In vitro, butriptyline is a strong antihistamine and anticholinergic, moderate 5-HT2 and Î±1-adrenergic receptor antagonist, and weak serotonin reuptake inhibitor, with negligible affinity for the norepinephrine and dopamine transporters. These actions appear to confer a profile similar to that of iprindole and trimipramine with serotonin-blocking effects as the predominant mediator of mood-lifting efficacy. However, in clinical trials, using similar doses, butriptyline was found to be even more effective than amitriptyline as an antidepressant, despite the fact that amitriptyline is much, much stronger as both a 5-HT2 antagonist and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. As a result, it can be inferred that butriptyline, in vivo, may function as a prodrug to a metabolite with more appreciable pharmacodynamics.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butylscopolamine	Butylscopolamine	160883		2Z3E1OF81V	149-64-4		Oral, rectal, intravenous		Butylscopolamine â€” also known as scopolamine butylbromide, butylhyoscine and hyoscine butylbromide â€” is a peripherally acting antimuscarinic, anticholinergic agent used as an abdominal-specific antispasmodic. It is a quaternary ammonium compound and a semisynthetic derivative of scopolamine. It is marketed under the trade name Buscopan by Boehringer Ingelheim GmbH, Germany, who also offer a combination of butylscopolamine and paracetamol, marketed under the name Buscopan Plus (in some countries, Buscopan Compositum). Butylscopolamine is used to treat pain and discomfort caused by abdominal cramps, menstrual cramps, or other spasmodic activity in the digestive system. It is also effective at preventing bladder spasms. It is not an analgesic in the normal sense, since it doesn't 'mask' or 'cover over' the pain, but rather works to prevent painful cramps and spasms from occurring in the first place. The attachment of the butyl-bromide moiety effectively prevents the movement of this drug across the bloodâ€“brain barrier, effectively minimising undesirable CNS side-effects associated with scopolamine/hyoscine.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clofenciclan	Clofenciclan	25904		P4BVX0D2MX	5632-52-0		Oral		Clofenciclan (Chlorphencyclan; Tonquil, Vesitan) is a dopamine-releasing agent developed by Boehringer & Soehne in the 1950s. It proved unpopular as a treatment because of its pronounced stimulant activity.

The drug is used in treating and preventing symptoms of acute alcohol withdrawal. It is a drug which is structurally related to thiamine (vitamin B1) but acts like a sedative, hypnotic, muscle relaxant and anticonvulsant. It is also used for the management of agitation, restlessness, short-term insomnia and Parkinson's disease in the elderly. In the U. K, it is sold under the brand Heminevrin. Another brand name includes Nevrin (in Romania) or Distraneurin in Germany. The drug is marketed either as a free base in an oily suspension containing 192Â mg in capsule form, or as clomethiazole edisylate syrup.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clopenthixol	Clopenthixol	12454		FLE878A8ZI	982-24-1		Oral		Clopenthixol (Sordinol), also known as clopentixol, is a typical antipsychotic drug of the thioxanthene class. It was introduced by Lundbeck in 1961. Clopenthixol is a racemic mixture of cis and trans isomers. Zuclopenthixol, the pure cis isomer, was later introduced by Lundbeck in 1962, and has been much more widely used. Both drugs are equally effective as antipsychotics and have similar adverse effect profiles, but clopenthixol is half as active on a milligram-to-milligram basis and appears to produce more sedation in comparison. Clopenthixol is not approved for use in the United States.

Unlike statins, which inhibit HMG-CoA reductase, lapaquistat metabolites inhibit squalene synthase, which is further downstream in the synthesis of cholesterol. It is hoped that side effects can be reduced by not disturbing the mevalonate pathway, which is important for other biochemical molecules besides cholesterol. However, there is increasing evidence that statins (which inhibit the mevalonate pathway) may be clinically useful because they affect these other molecules (including protein prenylation). On March 28, 2008, Takeda halted further development of lapaquistat.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linopirdine	Linopirdine	3932		I5TB3NZ94T	105431-72-9				Linopirdine is a putative cognition-enhancing drug with a novel mechanism of action. Linopirdine blocks the KCNQ2\3 heteromer M current with an IC50 of 2.4nM disinhibiting acetylcholine release, and increasing hippocampal CA3-schaffer collateral mediated glutamate release onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. In a murine model linopirdine is able to nearly completely reverse the senescence-related decline in cortical c-FOS, an effect which is blocked by atropine and MK-801, suggesting Linopirdine can compensate for the age related decline in acetylcholine release. Linopirdine also blocks homomeric KCNQ1 and KCNQ4 voltage gated potassium channels which contribute to vascular tone with substantially less selectivity than KCNQ2/3.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lisofylline	Lisofylline	501254		L1F2Q2X956	100324-81-0				Lisofylline (LSF) is a synthetic small molecule with novel anti-inflammatory properties. LSF can effectively prevent type 1 diabetes in preclinical models and improves the function and viability of isolated or transplanted pancreatic islets. As well, LSF improves cellular mitochondrial function and blocks interleukin-12 (IL-12) signaling and STAT-4 activation in target cells and tissues. IL-12 and STAT-4 activation are important pathways linked to inflammation and autoimmune damage to insulin producing cells. Therefore, LSF and related analogs could provide a new therapeutic approach to prevent or reverse type 1 diabetes.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lynestrenol	Lynestrenol	5857		N2Z8ALG4U5	52-76-6				Lynestrenol is a progestogen hormone. It is a synthetic orally-available progestagen associated with numerous effects of the natural progesterone hormone. Lynestrenol has a strong progestational effect on the uterine endometrium (transforming proliferative endometrium into secretory one), inhibits secretion of gonadotropin, suppresses maturation of follicles in the ovaries and ovulation, reduces menstrual bleeding. This synthetic gestagen is associated with minimal estrogenic, androgenic and anabolic effects. Lynestrenol is used in treatment of hormonal disorders and diseases caused by insufficient secretion of the natural progesterone, except in case of risky pregnancies and prevention of miscarriage, since it is not efficient enough in this indication.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pazinaclone	Pazinaclone	59743		MHK03047IJ	103255-66-9				Pazinaclone (DN-2327) is a sedative and anxiolytic drug in the cyclopyrrolone family of drugs. Other cyclopyrrolone drugs include zopiclone and eszopiclone. Pazinaclone has a very similar pharmacological profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs including sedative and anxiolytic properties, but with less amnestic effects, and at low doses it is a relatively selective anxiolytic, with sedative effects only appearing at higher doses. Pazinaclone produces its sedative and anxiolytic effects by acting as a partial agonist at GABAA benzodiazepine receptors, although pazinaclone is more subtype-selective than most benzodiazepines.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Penfluridol	Penfluridol	33630		25TLU22Q8H	26864-56-2				Penfluridol (Semap, Micefal) is a highly potent, first generation diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotic. It was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1968. Related to other diphenylbutylpiperidine antipsychotics, pimozide and fluspirilene, penfluridol has an extremely long elimination half-life and its effects last for many days after single oral dose. Its antipsychotic potency, in terms of dose needed to produce comparable effects, is similar to both haloperidol and pimozide. It is only slightly sedative, but often causes extrapyramidal side-effects, such as akathisia, dyskinesiae and pseudo-Parkinsonism. Penfluridol is indicated for antipsychotic treatment of chronic schizophrenia and similar psychotic disorders, it is, however, like most typical antipsychotics, being increasingly replaced by the atypical antipsychotics. Due to its extremely long lasting effects, it is often prescribed to be taken orally as tablets only once a week (q 7 days). The once-weekly doses is usually 10â€“60Â mg.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Phenadoxone	Phenadoxone	10089		375W3TA42N	467-84-5				Phenadoxone (Heptalgin, Morphidone, Heptazone) is an opioid analgesic of the open chain class invented in by Hoechst in 1947. It is one of a handful of useful synthetic analgesics which were used in the United States for various lengths of time in the 20 or so years after the end of the Second World War but which were withdrawn from the market for various or no known reason and which now are mostly in Schedule I of the United States' Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or in Schedule II but not produced or marketed in the US. Others on this list are ketobemidone (Ketogin), dextromoramide (Dimorlin, Palfium and others), phenazocine (Narphen and Prinadol), dipipanone (Diconal, Pipadone and Wellconal), piminodine (Alvodine), propiram (Algeril), anileridine (Leritine) and alphaprodine (Nisentil). Phenadoxone is generally considered to be a strong opioid analgesic and is regulated in much the same way as morphine where it is used. The usual starting dose is 10-20 mg and it has a duration of analgesic effect of 1 to 4 hours. By comparison, methadone has an analgesic effect lasting from 3 to 6 hours although for use in opioid maintenance the dose is different from that used for analgesia and the sought effect of suppressing withdrawal symptoms and part of the rush of heroin can last for 24 to 72 hours. Phenadoxone is not used at this time for purposes other than pain relief. Worldwide consumption of phenadoxone has actually increased slightly in recent years according a recent report from the World Health Organisation. Like its drug subcategory prototype methadone, phenadoxone can be used as the opioid analgesic in Brompton Mixture, aka Brompton cocktail. Phenadoxone is most used at the current time in Denmark and various countries in eastern Europe.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pheneridine	Pheneridine	3029031		2UG271VI0Z	469-80-7				"Pheneridine is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative that is related to the opioid analgesic drug pethidine (meperidine). Pheneridine is not currently used in medicine. Presumably it has similar effects to other opioid derivatives, such as analgesia, sedation, nausea and respiratory depression, however unlike most opioid derivatives it is not specifically listed as an illegal drug, although it would probably be regarded as a controlled substance analogue of pethidine on the grounds of its related chemical structure in some jurisdictions such as the USA, Canada and Australia, and would be classified as a ""Pethidine Analogue"" under the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act Class C7."

It has a similar pharmacological profile to the benzodiazepine family of drugs, but with mainly anxiolytic properties and very little sedative, amnestic or anticonvulsant effects, and so is classified as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. Pipequaline acts as a non-selective GABAA receptor partial agonist. While its profile of anxiolytic effects without sedation would appear to have potential medical applications, pipequaline has never been developed for medical use and is currently only used in scientific research.

It is subtype-selective, binding primarily to the Î±4Î²2 and also Î±6Î²2 subtypes. It has nootropic and neuroprotective effects, and animal studies suggested that it might be useful for the treatment of ADHD. Subsequent human trials have shown ABT-089 to both be effective for this application, and also to have particularly low tendency to cause side effects compared to other drugs in the class, making it a promising candidate for clinical development.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pravadoline	Pravadoline	56463		P3JW662TWA	92623-83-1				Pravadoline (WIN 48,098) is an antiinflammatory and analgesic drug with an IC50 of 4.9 ÂµM, related in structure to non-steroidal antinflammtory drugs such as indometacin. It was developed in the 1980s as a new antiinflammatory and prostaglandin synthesis inhibitor, acting through inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX). However, pravadoline was found to exhibit unexpectedly strong analgesic effects, which appeared at doses ten times smaller than the effective anti-inflammatory dose and so could not be explained by its action as a COX inhibitor. These effects were not blocked by opioid antagonists such as naloxone, and it was eventually discovered that pravadoline represented the first compound from a novel class of cannabinoid agonists, the aminoalkylindoles. Pravadoline was never developed for use as an analgesic, partly due to toxicity concerns (although these were later shown to be a result of the salt form that the drug had been prepared in rather than from the pravadoline itself), however the discovery of cannabinoid activity in this structurally novel family of drugs led to the discovery of several new cannabinoid agonists, including the drug WIN 55,212-2, which is now widely used in scientific research.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thiocarlide	Thiocarlide	3001386		43M23X81Y2	910-86-1				Thiocarlide (or tiocarlide or isoxyl) is a thiourea drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, inhibiting synthesis of oleic acid and tuberculostearic acid. Thiocarlide has considerable antimycobacterial activity in vitro and is effective against multi-drug resistant strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Isoxyl inhibits M. bovis with six hours of exposure, which is similar to isoniazid and ethionamide, two other prominent anti-TB drugs. Unlike these two drugs, however, isoxyl also partially inhibits the synthesis of fatty acids. Thiocarlide was developed by a Belgian company, Continental Pharma S.A. Belgo-Canadienne in Brussels, Belgium. The head researcher was Professor N. P. Buu-Hoi, head of Continental Pharma's Research Division.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trefentanil	Trefentanil	60728		36QM58LVGU	120656-93-1				Trefentanil (A-3665) is an opioid analgesic that is an analogue of fentanyl and was developed in 1992. Trefentanil is most similar to short-acting fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil. In comparative studies, trefentanil was slightly more potent and shorter acting than alfentanil as an analgesic, but induced significantly more severe respiratory depression. For this reason trefentanil has not been adopted for clinical use, although it is still used in research. Trefentanil has very similar effects to alfentanil, much like those of fentanyl itself but more potent and shorter lasting. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl, and include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. The risk of respiratory depression is especially high with potent fentanyl analogues such as alfentanil and trefentanil, and these drugs pose a significant risk of death if used outside of a hospital setting with appropriate artificial breathing apparatus available.

It is more active than other quinolones against Gram-positive bacteria such as MRSA. In contrast to most approved fluoroquinolones, which are zwitterionic, delafloxacin has an anionic character, which results in a 10-fold increase in delafloxacin accumulation in both bacteria and cells at acidic pH. This property is believed to confer to delafloxacin an advantage for the eradication of Staphylococcus aureus in acidic environments, including intracellular infections. Phase II clinical trials have been completed, including a trial with tigecycline as a comparator The company states Delafloxacin met its primary and secondary efficacy endpoints based on the draft guidance from the FDA. A Phase III trial for acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections (ABSSSI) is due to begin in the 2nd half of 2012.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tebanicline	Tebanicline	3075702		9KX8NKV538	198283-73-7				Tebanicline (Ebanicline, ABT-594) is a drug developed by Abbott, which acts as a partial agonist at neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, binding to both the Î±3Î²4 and the Î±4Î²2 subtypes. It was developed as a less toxic analogue of the potent frog-derived compound epibatidine, which is some 200x stronger than morphine as an analgesic but produces extremely dangerous toxic side effects. Like epibatidine, tebanicline showed potent analgesic activity against neuropathic pain in both animal and human trials, but with far less toxicity than its parent compound. Tebanicline got as far as Phase II trials in humans, but was dropped from further development due to unacceptable incidence of gastrointestinal side effects. However further research in this area is ongoing, and it is expected that development of new neural nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonists will be likely to lead to novel analgesics suitable for use in humans within the next few years.

Oxantel is currently being experimented with for the treatment of periodontal disease by the Cooperative Research Centre for Oral Health Science (CRC). Professor Eric Reynolds (also the head of Dental School at the University of Melbourne, Australia) and his Associate Professor Stuart Dashper are currently testing its ability as a Fumarate reductase inhibitor. Fumarate reductase is an enzyme that has been found in the pathogenic bacteria in the biofilm in periodontal pockets.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Piperaquine	Piperaquine	122262		A0HV2Q956Y	4085-31-8				Piperaquine is an antimalarial drug, a bisquinoline first synthesised in the 1960s, and used extensively in China and Indochina as prophylaxis and treatment during the next 20 years. Usage declined in the 1980s as piperaquine-resistant strains of P. falciparum arose and artemisinin-based antimalarials became available. However, Chinese scientists have been studying whether piperaquine can still be used therapeutically in combination with artemisinin. Piperaquine is characterized by slow absorption and a long biological half-life, making it a good partner drug with artemisinin derivatives which are fast acting but have a short biological half-life. The fixed-dose combination dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (Eurartesim) was submitted for approval to the European Medicines Agency in 2009.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitamin_B12	Vitamin B12	5479203	DB00115		68-19-9		oral, IV, IM	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Vitamin B12, vitamin B12 or vitamin B-12, also called cobalamin, is a water-soluble vitamin with a key role in the normal functioning of the brain and nervous system, and for the formation of blood. It is one of the eight B vitamins. It is normally involved in the metabolism of every cell of the human body, especially affecting DNA synthesis and regulation, but also fatty acid synthesis and energy production. Neither fungi, plants, nor animals are capable of producing vitamin B12. Only bacteria and archaea have the enzymes required for its synthesis, although many foods are a natural source of B12 because of bacterial symbiosis. The vitamin is the largest and most structurally complicated vitamin and can be produced industrially only through bacterial fermentation-synthesis. Vitamin B12 consists of a class of chemically related compounds, all of which have vitamin activity. It contains the biochemically rare element cobalt. Biosynthesis of the basic structure of the vitamin is accomplished only by bacteria (which usually produce hydroxocobalamin), but conversion between different forms of the vitamin can be accomplished in the human body. A common semi-synthetic form of the vitamin, cyanocobalamin, does not occur in nature, but is produced from bacterial hydroxocobalamin and then used in many pharmaceuticals and supplements, and as a food additive, because of its stability and lower production cost. In the body it is converted to the human physiological forms methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin, leaving behind the cyanide, albeit in minimal concentration. More recently, hydroxocobalamin, methylcobalamin, and adenosylcobalamin can be found in more expensive pharmacological products and food supplements. The extra utility of these is currently debated. Vitamin B12 was discovered from its relationship to the disease pernicious anemia, which is an autoimmune disease in which parietal cells of the stomach responsible for secreting intrinsic factor are destroyed. Intrinsic factor is crucial for the normal absorption of B12, so a lack of intrinsic factor, as seen in pernicious anemia, causes a vitamin B12 deficiency. Many other subtler kinds of vitamin B12 deficiency and their biochemical effects have since been elucidated.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/PEPAP	PEPAP	60977	DB01562		64-52-8				PEPAP is an opioid analgesic that is an analog of pethidine (meperidine). It is related to the drug MPPP, with an N-phenethyl group in place of the N-methyl substitution and an acetate ester rather than propionate. PEPAP is approximately 6-7 times more potent than morphine in laboratory rats. PEPAP presumably has similar effects to other opioids, producing analgesia, sedation and euphoria. Side effects can include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatening. PEPAP has been found to be a potent CYP2D6 inhibitor, which makes it likely to cause adverse interactions with some other drugs, although the inhibitory potency of PEPAP is less than that of MPPP. (Both cocaine and methadone are also CYP2D6 inhibitors and could, in theory, potentiate the effect. ) It is unlikely that the tetrahydropyridine byproducts that may be formed during the synthesis of PEPAP are neurotoxic in the same way as the MPPP byproduct MPTP. It appears that the N-methyl group of MPTP is required for neurotoxic activity. In animal experiments, only MPTP analogues that preserved the N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine structure were active as dopaminergic neurotoxins. Most structural changes, including replacing the N-methyl group with other substituents, abolished neurotoxicity. There is evidence that the clandestine manufacturers who produced MPPP in the 1970s (included the tainted batch) went on to produce PEPAP in an attempt to avoid using watched precursors or drug intermediates that were illegal.

The 1-methyl homologue of LSD has more of somatic than sensory effect, has fewer visuals and is less well accepted than LSD, with the range of dosages being from 100 to 300 micrograms. This indicates that it is perhaps a third the potency of LSD which is in accord with both pupillary dilation and reflex action. However, the cardiovascular responses are actually increased. Besides being less potent than LSD, it appears to have a slower onset but it is equally long lived. There is cross-tolerance between MLD-41 and LSD. Hepatic N-demethylation of MLD-41 (1-methyl-LSD)--producing the parent compound in vivo as a metaboliteâ€”may account for both the reduced potency and protracted onset of MLD-41 as a psychedelic. That is, the psychedelic activity of MLD-41 may be partially (or even entirely) due to the formation of LSD as an active metabolite. Metabolism of other 1-methylated-ergoloids to their secondary amine derivatives has been frequently noted in mammals.

It has been sold as an ingredient in legal recreational drugs known as ""Party pills"", initially in New Zealand and subsequently in other countries around the world. pFPP has been found in vitro to act mainly as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist, with some additionally affinity for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors. It has also been shown to inhibit the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, and to possibly induce their release. pFPP was originally discovered as a metabolite of the hypnotic antihistamine niaprazine in 1982, but was rediscovered in 2003 as a potential recreational drug, and sold as an ingredient in ""Party pills"" in New Zealand, under brand names such as ""The Big Grin"", ""Mashed"", and ""Extreme Beans"". Subsequently it has continued to be used as an ingredient in black market ""ecstasy"" pills around the world. pFPP has little stimulant effects, with its subjective effects derived mainly from its action as a 5-HT1A receptor agonist. pFPP is active at doses between 20 and 150Â mg, but higher doses cause a range of side-effects such as migraine headaches, muscle aches, anxiety, nausea, and vomiting. Metabolic studies have shown pFPP to be an inhibitor of various Cytochrome P450 enzymes in the liver which may contribute to its side-effect profile. Based on the recommendation of the EACD, the New Zealand government has passed legislation which placed BZP, along with a number of other piperazine derivatives, into Class C of the New Zealand Misuse of Drugs Act 1975. A ban was intended to come into effect in New Zealand on December 18, 2007, but the law change did not go through until the following year, and the sale of BZP and the other listed piperazines became illegal in New Zealand as of 1 April 2008. An amnesty for possession and usage of these drugs remained until October 2008, at which point they became completely illegal. This drug has been detected in a drug-facilitated sexual assault case in the United States of America."

MeOPP has been found in vitro to inhibit the reuptake and induce the release of the monoamine neurotransmitters. This is a mechanism of action shared with drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, and MeOPP produces somewhat similar effects although it is much less potent and is thought to have relatively insignificant abuse potential. Piperazine derivatives such as trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) have also been shown to exert a major part of their mechanism of action as nonselective serotonin receptor agonists, and MeOPP has also been demonstrated to act in this way. MeOPP is anecdotally said to induce significantly less anxiety than similar piperazines, and is usually taken at doses between 120â€“200Â mg. It does not produce prominent stimulant effects, but is instead said to be relaxing, however it is often mixed with stimulant piperazine derivatives such as benzylpiperazine (BZP) for a combined effect.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nicodicodeine	Nicodicodeine	5464304			808-24-2		Oral, intravenous		Nicodicodeine is an opiate derivative developed as a cough suppressant and analgesic. Synthesized in 1904, it is not commonly used, but has activity similar to other opiates. Nicodicodeine is metabolised in the liver by demethylation to produce 6-nicotinoyldihydromorphine, and subsequently further metabolised to dihydromorphine. Since the final active metabolite is the slightly stronger opiate dihydromorphine rather than morphine, nicodicodeine can be expected to be marginally more potent and longer acting than nicocodeine. Side effects are similar to those of other opiates and include itching, nausea and respiratory depression.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/TCB-2	TCB-2	16086382			912440-88-1		Oral		TCB-2 is a hallucinogen, discovered in 2006 by Thomas McLean, working in the lab of Prof. David Nichols at Purdue University where it was named 2C-BCB. It is a conformationally-restricted derivative of the phenethylamine 2C-B, also a hallucinogen, and acts as a potent agonist for the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors with a Ki of 0.26nM at the human 5-HT2A receptor. In drug-substitution experiments in rats, TCB-2 was found to be of similar potency to both LSD and Br-DFLY, ranking it among the most potent phenethylamine hallucinogens yet discovered. This high potency and selectivity has made TCB-2 useful for distinguishing 5-HT2A mediated responses from those produced by other similar receptors. TCB-2 has similar but not identical effects in animals to related phenethylamine hallucinogens such as DOI, and has been used for studying how the function of the 5HT2A receptor differs from that of other serotonin receptors in a number of animal models, such as studies of cocaine addiction and neuropathic pain. The related benzocyclobutene analogs of mescaline, Tomscaline and Bromotomscaline also exhibit significantly higher potency than their parent compound. The N-BnOMe (N-ortho-methoxybenzyl) analogs of TCB-2, Tomscaline, and Bromotomscaline were also synthesized.

It acts as a non-neurotoxic and highly selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA) and produces entactogen effects in humans. It has been sold as a designer drug and research chemical online since 2010. MMAI has been shown to relieve stress-induced depression in rats more robustly than sertraline, and as a result it has been suggested that SSRAs like MMAI and 4-MTA could be developed as novel antidepressants with a faster onset of therapeutic action and superior efficacy to current antidepressants such as the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Additionally it may relieve symptoms for up to one year, or an entire lifetime of the user.

It is relatively obscure, with limited human use, and produces slightly psychedelic effects. It has been encountered in illicit capsules as a recreational drug similarly to other piperazines like mCPP. Scientific research has demonstrated pCPP to have serotonergic effects, likely acting as a non-selective serotonin receptor agonist and/or releasing agent.

It has been shown to cross the blood-brain-barrier to a significantly greater extent than exogenously applied oxytocin, and in animal tests produces centrally-mediated oxytocinergic actions such as anxiolytic effects, but with no antidepressant effect evident. It was developed by a team at Ferring.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Chlorophenylisobutylamine	4-Chlorophenylisobutylamine	150989			2275-64-1		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		4-Chlorophenylisobutylamine (4-CAB, AEPCA), also known as 4-chloro-Î±-ethylphenethylamine, is an entactogen and stimulant drug of the phenethylamine class. It is an analogue of para-chloroamphetamine (PCA) where the alpha position methyl has been replaced with an ethyl group. In comparison to PCA, 4-CAB is approximately 2- and 5-fold less potent at inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin (IC50 = 330 nM) and dopamine (IC50 = 2,343 nM), respectively, and is about 3-fold less potent in substituting for MDMA in animals in drug discrimination assays. Though its dopaminergic activity is significantly attenuated compared to PCA, unlike the case of MBDB, it is not abolished, and is actually similar to that of MDMA. Relative to PCA, 4-CAB is also substantially less effective as a serotonergic neurotoxin. A single 10Â mg/kg administration of PCA to rats produces an approximate 80% decrease in serotonin markers as observed 1 week later. In contrast, 11Â mg/kg and 22Â mg/kg doses of 4-CAB result in only 20% and 50% decreases, respectively. This is once again similar to MDMA which causes a 40-60% reduction with a single 20Â mg/kg dose.

Hodgkinsine has antiviral, antibacterial and antifungal effects, but has mainly been researched for the analgesic effects that it produces, and is thought to be one of the components responsible for the analgesic effects seen when Psychotria colorata is used in traditional medical practice in humans. It has been found to act as both a mu opioid agonist and an NMDA antagonist, both of which are mechanisms of action shared with commonly used painkillers. Hodgkinsine is a trimer composed of three pyrrolidinoindoline subunits, with the monomer closely resembling another alkaloid eseroline which has similar bioactivity. Due to its complex structure and multiple chiral centres, hodgkinsine has many stereoisomers and significant research has been undertaken to elucidate the structure-activity relationships of the various isomers and synthetic derivatives structurally derived from hodgkinsine.

PMMA is the 4-methoxy analog of methamphetamine. Little is known about the pharmacological properties, metabolism, and toxicity of PMMA; because of its structural similarity to PMA, which has known toxicity in humans, it is thought to have considerable potential to cause harmful side effects or death in overdose. In the early 2010s, a number of deaths in users of the drug ecstasy were linked to misrepresented tablets and capsules of PMMA. Its effects in humans are reputedly similar to those of PMA, but slightly more empathogenic in nature. It has a reduced tendency to produce severe hyperthermia at low dosages, but at higher dosages side effects and risk of death becomes similar to those of PMA. The synthesis and effects of PMMA were described by American experimental chemist Alexander Shulgin in his book PiHKAL, where it is referred to by the name ""Methyl-MA"", as the n-methylated form of 4-MA (PMA). Shulgin reported that PMMA produces an increase in blood pressure and in heart rate, at doses above 100Â mg, but causes no psychoactive effects at these levels."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tricyanoaminopropene	Tricyanoaminopropene	13356			868-54-2				Tricyanoaminopropene (TRIAP, TCAP, Malononitrile Dimer, 1,1,3-tricyano-2-amino-1-propene) is a nootropic drug which mimics the function of nerve growth factor and increases the growth of nerves and tissue regeneration both in isolated tissues and in vivo. It stimulates the action of the enzyme choline acetyltransferase, resulting in increased acetylcholine production. This then results in increased synthesis of RNA in many different tissues in the body. However it also suppresses the production of thyroxine, causing temporary hypothyroidism which returns to normal once the drug is discontinued. Tricyanoaminopropene reduces the amnesia produced by electroconvulsive shock, and animal tests suggested nootropic activity, but no beneficial effect was found when it was tested in retarded children, and administration to pregnant rats actually reduced learning ability in their young because of its anti-thyroid hormone effects. This drug thus produces two effects which oppose each other, with the nootropic effect from the increased acetylcholine production cancelled out by the opposite effect produced by the decrease in production of thyroxine. It is not known whether the efficacy of the drug could be improved by supplementation with additional thyroxine or equivalent drugs.

It is similar in structure to the appetite suppressant diethylpropion and has analogous effects in animals. Little is known about this compound, but it has been detected by laboratories in Germany as an ingredient in ""ecstasy"" tablets seized by law enforcement authorities. This drug has been found to produce stimulant effects in animals and presumably also produces these effects in humans, based on the context in which it has been found. Î±-PPP is illegal in the UK under the blanket ban on substituted cathinones, and due to its structural similarity to illegal drugs such as methcathinone and pyrovalerone it might be considered a controlled substance analogue in some countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand. Analogues of Î±-PPP such as pyrovalerone and MDPV have been more widely used and are presumed to be more potent and addictive than Î±-PPP itself. Structure-activity relationships of these drugs suggest that a variety of ring-substituted analogues are likely to be potential drugs of abuse, and stimulant activity has been found for analogues with between 3 and 6 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain."

The 5-HT1D receptor has a very similar pharmacology to the closely related 5-HT1B receptor, and most older ligands for these receptors bind to both subtypes with approximately equal affinity, so development of compounds such as BRL-15572 which are able to selectively block the 5-HT1D subtype while leaving 5-HT1B unaffected, have been a significant advance which has helped scientists in researching the function of these serotonin receptor subtypes. One function of the 5-HT1D receptor this research has revealed is its role in modulating release of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain, as well as functions in regulation of cerebral blood pressure which are important in the pathogenesis of migraine headaches.

It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, during research to improve upon the properties of earlier agents such as QNB. CAR-226,086 was relatively poorly researched compared to other compounds in the series, but notably was found to have the highest central to peripheral effects ratio out of all compounds tested, even higher than that of other CNS-selective agents such as EA-3443.

It was developed under contract to Edgewood Arsenal during the 1960s as part of the US military chemical weapons program, during research to improve upon the properties of earlier agents such as QNB. CAR-302,196 was found to be only around 1/4 the potency of QNB, but its onset of action was much faster at only a few minutes, and the duration far shorter at only 2-3 hours. A fast-acting and short-lasting anticholinergic drug was felt to be more desirable for some applications.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ditran	Ditran	111040			8015-54-1				"Ditran (JB-329) is an anticholinergic drug mixture, related to the chemical warfare agent 3-Quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB). Ditran is composed of a mixture of 70% 1-ethyl-2-pyrrolidinylmethyl-alpha- phenylcyclopentylglycolate and 30% 1-ethyl-3-piperidyl-alpha-phenylcyclopentylglycolate. These compounds are structural isomers and have very similar pharmacological properties. The piperidine compound is the more potent of the two and the reason the mixture was used was because of ease of manufacture, however it is also possible to make the piperidine compound in its pure form, so there were ultimately two forms of Ditran used in research, the original 70/30 mix, and ""Ditran-B"", the pure piperidine compound. Ditran was developed during chemical weapons research in an attempt to produce non-lethal incapacitating agents, similar to QNB itself. The ditran mixture is more potent as an anticholinergic than the piperidyl benzilate drugs such as N-methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate, but is less potent than QNB. There has been a modest amount of scientific research using this mixture, but most modern research using these kind of anticholinergic drugs uses N-methyl-3-piperidyl benzilate due to its wider availability."

N-Ethyl-3-piperidyl benzilate is less potent and shorter acting than 3-quinuclidyl benzilate, but like 3-QNB its effects on the central nervous system predominate over peripheral effects. It produces deliriant and hallucinogenic effects similar to those of plants such as datura and may be used recreationally at low doses, however unpleasant side effects such as dysphoria, nausea and vomiting, dizziness and extreme dry mouth tend to make abuse of these kind of drugs uncommon. Both the N-methyl and N-ethyl analogues of 3-piperidyl benzilate are however Schedule I controlled drugs. Radiolabelled versions of this drug have been used in scientific research to map the distribution of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors in the brain, however this drug has slightly lower binding affinity than the N-methyl analogue and so is less potent and not so widely used for this application.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/WAY-100,135	WAY-100,135	115111			133025-23-7				WAY-100,135 is a serotonergic drug of the phenylpiperazine family which is used in scientific research. It acts as potent 5-HT1A receptor antagonist, and was originally believed to be highly selective, but further studies have demonstrated that it also acts as a partial agonist of the 5-HT1D receptor (pKi = 7.58; virtually the same affinity for 5-HT1A), and to a much lesser extent, of the 5-HT1B receptor (pKi = 5.82). These findings may have prompted the development of the related compound WAY-100,635, another purportedly selective and even more potent 5-HT1A antagonist, which was synthesized shortly thereafter. However, WAY-100,635 turned out to be non-selective as well, having been shown to act additionally as a potent D4 receptor agonist later on.

It produces some of the same effects as other benzodiazepines, but is much more subtype-selective than most other drugs of this class, having high selectivity, binding affinity and efficacy at the Î±5 subtype of the GABAA receptor. This gives much tighter control of the effects produced, and so while SH-053-R-CH3-2â€²F retains sedative and anxiolytic effects, it does not cause ataxia at moderate doses. SH-053-R-CH3-2â€²F also blocks the nootropic effects of the Î±5-selective inverse agonist PWZ-029, so amnesia is also a likely side effect. 40px This pharmacology-related article is a stub.

In contrast to RTI-113 which is DAT selective, RTI-112 is a nonselective triple reuptake inhibitor. The in vitro tests actually show a very similar SERT/DAT/NET selectivity to cocaine, although in vivo they behave differently. ""the nonselective monoamine transporter inhibitor RTI-126 and the DAT-selective inhibitors RTI-150 and RTI-336 both had a faster rate of onset (30 min) and a short duration of action (4h). In contrast, the nonselective monoamine transporter inhibitor RTI-112 had a slower rate of onset (30â€“60 min) and a longer duration of action (10h). The DAT-selective inhibitors RTI-171 and RTI-177 also had slower rates of onset (30â€“120 min), but RTI-171 had a short duration of action (2.5 h) while RTI-177 had a very long duration of action (20 h). "" The efficacy of cocaine analogs to elicit self administration is related to the rate at which they are administered. Slower onset analogs are less likely to function as behavioral stimulants than analogs eliciting a faster rate of onset. Nonselective analogs are less likely to function as ""reinforcers"" than reuptake inhibitors that have DAT specificity. In order for a DRI such as cocaine to induce euphoria PET scans on primates reveal that the DAT occupancy needs to be >60%. RTI-112 is a particularly interesting nonselective cocaine-analog that has equipotent in vitro affinity at the SERT, NET and DAT, respectively. RTI-112 was not reliably self-administered, in contrast to the DAT selective reuptake inhibitors that were used in this study. Particularly notable is the fact that in vivo at the ED50, RTI-112 had no DAT occupancy at all. At the ED50, (mostly) all of the RTI-112 occupied the SERT at this dose. Significantly higher dose was required to get >70% DAT occupancy in the case of RTI-112. However RTI-112 was still able to suppress cocaine administration at the ED50 suggesting a serotonergic mechanism was responsible for this."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/DiFMDA	DiFMDA				910393-51-0				Difluoromethylenedioxyamphetamine (DiFMDA) is a substituted derivative of methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), which was developed by Daniel Trachsel and coworkers, along with the corresponding fluorinated derivatives of MDMA, MDEA, BDB and MBDB, with the aim of finding a non-neurotoxic drug able to be used as a less harmful substitute for entactogenic drugs such as MDMA. Since a major route of the normal metabolism of these compounds is scission of the methylenedioxy ring, producing neurotoxic metabolites such as alpha-methyldopamine, it was hoped that the difluoromethylenedioxy bioisostere would show increased metabolic stability and less toxicity. These compounds have not yet been tested in animals to verify whether they show similar pharmacological activity to the non-fluorinated parent compounds, although in vitro binding studies show DFMDA to have a SERT affinity in between that of MDA and MDMA. However there is known to be a lack of bulk tolerance at this position of the molecule, shown by the generally reduced activity of the ethylidenedioxy and isopropylidenedioxy analogues. It is also now generally accepted that MDMA neurotoxicity results from a variety of different causes and is not solely due to accumulation of alpha-methyldopamine, making it unclear how much less neurotoxic DFMDA and related drugs would be in practice.

Atovaquone alone is not indicated for treatment or prevention of malaria as monotherapy (i.e. , without proguanil). A standard tablet of Malarone contains 100Â mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 250Â mg of atovaquone. A pediatric tablet contains 25Â mg of proguanil hydrochloride and 62.5Â mg of atovaquone.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/IC-26	IC-26	113832							IC-26 (WIN 1161-3, Methiodone) is an analogue of the opioid analgesic methadone, where the carbonyl group has been replaced by the bioisosteric sulfone group. Human and animal studies suggest that IC-26 is around the same potency as methadone, although other studies have found its activity to be inconsistent between different patients, with consistent opioid activity only being seen at a dose several times that of methadone. IC-26 was assessed for its abuse potential, but despite being found to have similar potential to methadone for development of dependence it was never placed under international control as an illegal drug.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JDTic	JDTic	9956146							"JDTic is a drug that acts as an opioid antagonist, which is highly selective for the Îº-opioid receptor, and blocks this receptor without affecting the Î¼- or Î´-opioid receptors. It is a 4-phenylpiperidine derivative, distantly structurally related to analgesic drugs such as meperidine and ketobemidone, and more closely to the Î¼ opioid antagonist alvimopan, and is structurally distinct from other Îº antagonists such as norbinaltorphimine. It has a very long duration of action, with effects in animals seen for up to several weeks after administration of a single dose, although its binding to the Îº opioid receptor is not irreversible and its long-acting effects are instead caused by altered activity of c-Jun N-terminal kinases. Animal studies suggest that it may produce antidepressant and anxiolytic effects, as well as having possible application in the treatment of addiction to cocaine and morphine. The high affinity of JDTic for the Îº-opioid receptor suggested that it might be a suitable ligand for promoting the crystallization of this receptor for X-ray crystallographic studies. Such experiments were successful and lead to the publication of the first report of a high-resolution structure of an opioid receptor [ PDB 4DJH ]. The first human trial of JDTic was halted abruptly in May 2012 due to ""adverse events."""

It has been useful in the mapping of the group II mGluR receptor proteins and their molecular modeling. HYDIA is similar in structure to group II mGluR agonists such as eglumegad and LY-404,039, but the addition of the 3-hydroxy group reverses the activity to a competitive antagonist. Other derivatives such as the 3-benzyloxy ether are more potent antagonists than HYDIA itself.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/SB-271,046	SB-271,046	5312149							SB-271,046 is a drug which is used in scientific research. It was one of the first selective 5-HT6 receptor antagonists to be discovered, and was found through high-throughput screening of the SmithKline Beecham Compound Bank using cloned 5-HT6 receptors as a target, with an initial lead compound being developed into SB-271,046 through a structure-activity relationship (SAR) study. SB-271,046 was found to be potent and selective in vitro and had good oral bioavailability in vivo, but had poor penetration across the bloodâ€“brain barrier, so further SAR work was then conducted, which led to improved 5-HT6 antagonists such as SB-357,134 and SB-399,885. SB-271,046 was found to increase levels of the excitatory amino acid neurotransmitters glutamate and aspartate, as well as dopamine and noradrenaline in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats, and 5-HT6 antagonists have been shown to produce nootropic effects in a variety of animal studies. Suggested applications of these drugs include treatment of schizophrenia and other psychiatric disorders.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SB-357,134	SB-357,134	6918553							SB-357,134 is a drug which is used in scientific research. It acts as a potent, selective and orally active 5-HT6 receptor antagonist. SB-357,134 and other 5-HT6 antagonists show nootropic effects in animal studies, and have been proposed as potential novel treatments for cognitive disorders such as schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease.

In animal studies, it shows nootropic effects and may be useful in the treatment of schizophrenia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Methylmethylphenidate	4-Methylmethylphenidate	44296147							threo-4-Methylmethylphenidate (4-MeTMP) is a stimulant drug related to methylphenidate. It is slightly less potent than methylphenidate and has relatively low efficacy at blocking dopamine reuptake despite its high binding affinity, which led to its investigation as a possible substitute drug for treatment of stimulant abuse. On the other hand several other simple ring-substituted derivatives of threo-methylphenidate such as the 4-fluoro and 3-chloro compounds are more potent than methylphenidate both in efficacy as dopamine reuptake inhibitors and in animal drug discrimination assays.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/5-MeO-NBpBrT	5-MeO-NBpBrT	5124753							5-MeO-NBpBrT (5-Methoxy-N-tryptamine) is a drug which acts as an antagonist for the 5-HT2A receptor, with a claimed 100x selectivity over the closely related 5-HT2C receptor. While N-benzyl substitution of psychedelic phenethylamines often results in potent 5-HT2A agonists, N-benzyl tryptamines show much lower efficacy and are either very weak partial agonists or antagonists at 5-HT2A.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/O-2694	O-2694	11714280							O-2694 is a drug that is a cannabinoid derivative. It has analgesic effects and is used in scientific research. Unlike most cannabinoids discovered to date, it is highly water-soluble, which gives it considerable advantages over many related drugs. It has high affinity for both CB1 and CB2 receptors, with Ki values of 3.7nM at CB1 and 2.8nM at CB2. However, it has complex pharmacokinetics as most of the administered dose is metabolised by hydrolysis of the ester link to the water-insoluble compound O-2372, thus producing a biphasic effects profile that is less suitable for research purposes than the related compound O-2545.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/SoRI-20041	SoRI-20041	44310972							"SoRI-20041 is an ""antagonist-like"" allosteric modulator of amphetamine-induced dopamine release (in contrast to the related research chemicals SoRI-9804 and SoRI-20040, which are ""agonist-like""). SoRI-20041 is believed to be the first example of a drug that separately modulates uptake versus release in the dopamine transporter (possibly showing how inward and outward transport represent distinct operational modes of DAT); it produced the same effects as SoRI-20040 and SoRI-9804 in uptake assays and binding assays, inhibiting the re-uptake of dopamine, but did not modulate d-amphetamine-induced DA release by inhibiting that as well, like 'agonists' of the series do. This suggests the possibility of simultaneous action & increase of indirect-agonism through the dual-action of DRA & DRI efficacy existing together. Greatening of the inhibition of re-uptake at synaptic dopamine concentrations without interference to the flow of release of dopamine from amphetaminergic phosphorylation at the transporter so effected. This overcomes the obstacle of a compromised binding site which would be rendered unusable through the action of amphetamine. A site which conventional dopamine re-uptake inhibitors would otherwise ineffectively target on each specific transporter so effected by amphetamine. Making this an example of a DRI that does not have a mutually exclusive functionality against DRA action at individual instances of DAT."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paracetamol/metoclopramide	Paracetamol/metoclopramide						Oral		Paracetamol/metoclopramide hydrochloride is an oral fixed dose combination prescription medication containing the analgesic paracetamol (500Â mg) and the anti-emetic metoclopramide hydrochloride (5Â mg). Formulated as a tablet and as sachets of a water-soluble powder, it is sold under the trade name Paramax by Sanofi-Synthelabo, and in Switzerland as Migraeflux MCP http://www. migraeflux. org/, in Australia it is sold as Meteclomax and Anagraine. The combination is used to treat the symptoms of migraine, both to relieve headache (the analgesic) and to treat associated nausea and vomiting (the antiemetic). In addition to its direct anti-emetic effect metoclopramide also stimulates gastric emptying, which is often delayed during migraine attacks, and accelerates the absorption of paracetamol. However the improvement in paracetamol absorption has been questioned. The combination of metoclopramide to the paracetamol has been shown to enhance the analgesia relief when used to treat the pain of arthritis. Whilst the individual component drugs may be prescribed individually, as a combination, it is only available as the branded Paramax preparation in the UK. In the UK there are only two other combination analgesics with antiemetics (i.e. , anti-nausea) products available: MigraMax and the over-the-counter drug Migraleve (paracetamol and codeine for analgesia, with buclizine as the antiemetic). The role for these products is between just the use of simple analgesics (paracetamol or ibuprofen) and the triptan class of drugs; although the latter are not options during pregnancy. In the elderly although triptans are generally avoided, so too are antiemetics such as metoclopramide due to higher risks of side effects. In Australia and New Zealand, the combination is available without prescription from pharmacies.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ty21a	Ty21a						oral		Ty21a is a live attenuated bacterial vaccine that protects against typhoid. It is one of two typhoid vaccines currently recommended by the World Health Organization. The vaccine offers a statistically significant protection for the first three years, with between 8% to 54% effectiveness for the first year and between 40% to 71% for the second year. The vaccine is most commonly used to protect travellers to endemic countries, but there is no reason why the vaccine could not be used in large scale public prevention programmes. The vaccine is given by mouth. The vaccine is presented either as capsules or a liquid suspension. The vaccine must be stored at 2 to 8 Â°C, but will retain its potency for 14 days at 25Â°C.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/1-Methyl-5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine	1-Methyl-5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine						oral, insufflated, smoked, IV		1-Methyl-5-methoxy-diisopropyltryptamine (also known as 1-methyl-5-methoxy-N,N-diisopropyltryptamine, and 1-Me-5-MeO-DiPT) is a tryptamine that is used recreationally as a psychedelic. 1-methyl-5-MeO-DiPT is orally active, and dosages between 20-40 mg are commonly reported. Many users note that the an unpleasant body load that accompanies higher dosages of 5-MeO-DiPT is often absent when taking 1-methyl-5-MeO-DiPT. 1-methyl-5-MeO-DiPT is also taken by insufflation, or sometimes it is smoked or injected. Some users also report sound distortion, also noted with the related drug, DiPT. 1-methyl-5-MeO-DiPT is the 1-methyl homologue of 5-MeO-DiPT with a methyl group on the 1 position - the nitrogen in the tryptamine skeleton.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Flupentixol/melitracen	Flupentixol/melitracen						Oral		Flupentixol/melitracen (trade name Deanxit, Anxidreg) is a combination of two psychoactive agents which has antidepressant properties. It is designed for short term usage only. It is produced by Lundbeck. In January 2013, the Drugs Controller General of India gave the manufacturers of this combination six months to establish safety and efficacy on Indian patients, or the sale of the medication will be prohibited. The reasons given were the absence of approval for Deanxit in the country of its origin, Denmark (under Indian law, a drug cannot be marketed in India unless it is approved in its country of origin) and its absence from the U.S. , UK, Canada, Australia and Japan markets. Furthermore, no clinical trials were carried out in India prior to approval of Deanxit.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine	Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine						Oral		Sulfadoxine/pyrimethamine (Fansidar) is a combination antimalarial containing the sulfonamide antibacterial sulfadoxine and the antiparasitic pyrimethamine. Both drugs are antifolates; they inhibit the production of enzymes involved in the synthesis of folic acid within the parasites. Either drug by itself is only moderately effective in treating malaria, because the parasite Plasmodium falciparum may be able to use exogenous folic acid, i.e. folic acid which is present in the parasite's environment, while in combination, the two substances have a synergistic effect which outbalances that ability. The combination is considered to be more effective in treating malaria caused by Plasmodium falciparum than that caused by Plasmodium vivax, for which chloroquine is considered more effective, though in the absence of a species-specific diagnosis the sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine combination may be indicated. Due to side effects, however, it is no longer recommended as a routine preventative, but only to treat serious malaria infections or to prevent them in areas where other drugs may not work.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oxycodone/naloxone	Oxycodone/naloxone						Oral		The combination oxycodone/naloxone is an opioid analgesic available as managed-release tablets under the trade names Targin, Targiniq and Targinact. Oxycodone is responsible for the pain-relieving effects, while naloxone reduces opioid-induced constipation. Constipation was significantly relieved in a 2008 study. The drug was released in 2006 in Germany and is available in some other European countries since 2009.

It has similar effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and so is classed as a nonbenzodiazepine anxiolytic. It is a subtype-selective partial agonist at GABAA receptors, binding selectively to GABAA receptor complexes bearing Î±2 and Î±3 subunits. It has modest anticonvulsant activity although less than that of diazepam, and its main effect is likely to be selective anxiolytic action, as seen with other related Î±2/3-preferring agonists such as L-838,417.

One version of the vaccine consists of formaldehyde-inactivated Rickettsia prowazekii. Two doses are injected subcutaneously four weeks apart. Booster doses are required every six to twelve months.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/VCHSR	VCHSR								VCHSR is a drug used in scientific research which acts as a selective antagonist of the cannabinoid receptor CB1. It is derived from the widely used CB1 antagonist rimonabant, and has similar potency and selectivity for the CB1 receptor, but has been modified to remove the hydrogen bonding capability in the C-3 substituent region, which removes the inverse agonist effect that rimonabant produces at high doses, so that VCHSR instead acts as a neutral antagonist, blocking the receptor but producing no physiological effect of its own.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/CR6261	CR6261								"CR6261 is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a broad range of the influenza virus including the 1918 ""Spanish flu"" (SC1918/H1) and to a virus of the H5N1 class of avian influenza that jumped from chickens to a human in Vietnam in 2004 (Viet04/H5). In contrast to most antibodies generated by exposure to influenza, which can only neutralize a few strains from within a single virus subtype, CR6261 neutralizes numerous strains from multiple subtypes. CR6261 recognizes a highly conserved helical region in the membrane-proximal stem of hemagglutinin, the predominant protein on the surface of the influenza virus. Based upon the conservation of the amino acid sequence on this part of hemagglutinin, CR6261 is predicted to neutralize roughly 50% of all flu viruses. It was found by The Scripps Research Institute and the Dutch biopharmaceutical company, Crucell."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dibenzoylmorphine	Dibenzoylmorphine								"Dibenzoylmorphine is an opiate analogue that is a derivative of morphine. It was developed in the early 1900s after first having been synthesised in 1875 in the UK, along with various other esters of morphine, but was never used medically, instead being widely sold as one of the first ""designer drugs"" for around five years following the introduction of the first international restrictions on the sale of heroin in 1925. It is described as being virtually identical to heroin and morphine in its effects, and consequently was itself banned internationally in 1930 by the Health Committee of the League of Nations, in order to prevent its sale as an unscheduled alternative to diacetylmorphine."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/JWH-424	JWH-424								JWH-424 is a drug from the naphthoylindole family, which acts as a cannabinoid agonist at both the CB1 and CB2 receptors, but with moderate selectivity for CB2, having a Ki of 5.44nM at CB2 vs 20.9nM at CB1. The heavier 8-iodo analogue is even more CB2 selective, with its 2-methyl derivative having 40x selectivity for CB2. However the 1-propyl homologues in this series showed much lower affinity at both receptors, reflecting a generally reduced affinity for the 8-substituted naphthoylindoles overall.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sporolides	Sporolides								Sporolides A and B are novel polycyclic macrolides from the obligate marine bacterium Salinispora tropica (which is found in ocean sediment) that are composed of a chlorinated cyclopenta[a a]indene ring and a cyclohexenone moiety. They are only the second class of compounds isolated from the Salinispora, and their unique carbon skeleton provides a clear indication of the tremendous potential of marine actinomycetes as a source of novel secondary metabolites. The structures and absolute stereochemistries of both metabolites were elucidated using a combination of NMR spectroscopy and X-ray crystallography, and are considered unique for two reasons: - both compounds appear to be polyketides and therefore derived from acetate units, - the number of oxidized carbons is amazing, with 23 of 24 carbons either oxygenated or sp2 - hybridized. The complex aromatic structure of the sporolides is hypothesized to be derived from an unstable nine-membered ring enediyne precursor, which undergoes Bergman cyclization to generate a p-benzyne intermediate. A nucleophilic attack by chloride accounts for the 1:1 mixtures and for the single chlorine in enediyne-derived natural products. This mechanism has been recently demonstrated in laboratory experiments, and can account for the biosynthesis of sporolides.

Â 14pxYÂ (what is this?)Â Â (verify) DPT (also DTP and DTwP) refers to a class of combination vaccines against three infectious diseases in humans: diphtheria, pertussis (whooping cough) and tetanus. The vaccine components include diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, and killed whole cells of the organism that causes pertussis (wP). DTaP and Tdap refer to similar combination vaccines in which the pertussis component is acellular. Also available is the DT or TD vaccine, which lacks the pertussis component. In the Netherlands and in France, the acronym DTP refers to a combination vaccine against diphtheria, tetanus, and poliomyelitis. In the Netherlands, pertussis is known as kinkhoest and DKTP refers to a combination vaccine against diphtheria, pertussis/kinkhoest, tetanus, and polio. The usual course of childhood immunization is five doses between 2 months and 15 years. For adults, separate combination vaccines are used that adjust the relative concentrations of their components.

Before long, however, it had become clear that glutethimide was just as likely to cause addiction and caused similarly severe withdrawal symptoms. Doriden is the brand-name version of the drug; both the generic and brand-name forms are rarely prescribed today.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydralazine	Hydralazine	3637	DB01275	26NAK24LS8	86-54-4		Oral, intravenous	Hepatic	Hydralazine (apresoline) is a direct-acting smooth muscle relaxant used to treat hypertension by acting as a vasodilator primarily in arteries and arterioles. By relaxing vascular smooth muscle, vasodilators act to decrease peripheral resistance, thereby lowering blood pressure and decreasing afterload. However, this only has a short term effect on blood pressure, as the system will reset to the previous, high blood pressure necessary to maintain pressure in the kidney necessary for natriuresis. The long term effect of antihypertensive drugs comes from their effects on the pressure natriuresis curve. It belongs to the hydrazinophthalazine class of drugs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hydrocodone	Hydrocodone	5284569	DB00956	6YKS4Y3WQ7	125-29-1		oral, intranasal, rectal	Hepatic	Hydrocodone or dihydrocodeinone is a semi-synthetic opioid derived from either of two naturally occurring opiates: codeine and thebaine. It is an orally active narcotic analgesic and antitussive. It is available in tablet, capsule, and syrup form. Hydrocodone is often compounded with other, non-opioid, compounds, such as paracetamol (also known as acetaminophen) or ibuprofen to provide a possible synergy of analgesic effects between hydrocodone and the non-opioid compounds present. The particular niche in which hydrocodone is most commonly used is as an intermediate centrally acting analgesic (painkiller). Abrupt discontinuation of hydrocodone may result in withdrawal symptoms. Because of concerns about liver damage from protracted use of paracetamol at high doses, four pharmaceutical companies are developing extended-release capsules and other forms of hydrocodone by itself.

It was first synthesized by Union Chimique Belge in 1956 and was marketed by Pfizer in the United States later the same year, and is still in widespread use today. Due to its antagonistic effects on several receptor systems in the brain, hydroxyzine has strong anxiolytic and mild antiobsessive as well as antipsychotic properties. Today it is used primarily for the symptomatic relief of anxiety and tension associated with psychoneurosis and as an adjunct in organic disease states in which anxiety is manifested. Because of its antihistamine effects it can also be used for the treatment of severe cases of itching, hyperalgesia and motion sickness-induced nausea. Even though it is an effective sedative, hypnotic, analgesic, and tranquilizer, it allegedly shares virtually none of the abuse, dependence, addiction, and toxicity potential of other drugs used for the same range of therapeutic reasons. Hydroxyzine has been used in medical practice with opioid analgesics to increase the analgesic efficacy of opioids, and by recreational drug users to maximise the effects of opiates, and/or preempt some side effects of opioids like itching, nausea, and vomiting. Hydroxyzine preparations usually require a doctor's prescription. The drug is available in two formulations, the pamoate and the dihydrochloride or hydrochloride salts. Vistaril, Equipose, Masmoran, and Paxistil are preparations of the pamoate salt, while Atarax, Alamon, Aterax, Durrax, Tran-Q, Orgatrax, Quiess, and Tranquizine are of the hydrochloride salt. Other drugs related to hydroxyzine are cyclizine, buclizine, and meclizine, and they share all or most of the benefits, indications, contraindications, cautions, and side effects of hydroxyzine. The second-generation antihistamine cetirizine is in fact one of the metabolites of hydroxyzine produced in the human body. Unlike hydroxyzine, cetirizine is not purported to appreciably to cross the blood-brain-barrier, but it has been reported to be associated with dystonic reactions as well as sedation. Therefore it has a narrower spectrum of effects, making it an effective antihistamine but removing some or all of the anxiolytic and analgesic-sparing properties, but it may cause dystonic reactions and drowsiness in some patients.

It is a secondary metabolite found in certain plants of the Solanaceae family, including henbane, mandrake, jimsonweed, tomato and deadly nightshade. It is the levorotary isomer of atropine (third of the three major nightshade alkaloids) and thus sometimes known as levo-atropine. Hyoscyamine should not be confused with hyoscine, an older alternate name for the related nightshade-derived anticholinergic scopolamine for which it is the precursor. Brand names for hyoscyamine include Symax, HyoMax, Anaspaz, Egazil, Buwecon, Cystospaz, Levsin, Levbid, Levsinex, Donnamar, NuLev, Spacol T/S and Neoquess.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lamotrigine	Lamotrigine	3878	DB00555	U3H27498KS	84057-84-1		Oral	Hepatic	Lamotrigine, marketed in the US and most of Europe as Lamictal by GlaxoSmithKline, is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It is also used off-label as an adjunct in treating depression. For epilepsy, it is used to treat focal seizures, primary and secondary tonic-clonic seizures, and seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Like many other anticonvulsant medications, Lamotrigine also seems to act as an effective mood stabilizer, and has been the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drug for this purpose since lithium, a drug approved almost 30 years earlier. It is approved for the maintenance treatment of bipolar type I. Chemically unrelated to other anticonvulsants (due to lamotrigine's being a phenyltriazine), lamotrigine has many possible side-effects. Lamotrigine is generally accepted to be a member of the sodium channel blocking class of antiepileptic drugs, but it could have additional actions inasmuch as it has a broader spectrum of action than other sodium channel antiepileptic drugs such as phenytoin and carbamazepine and is effective in the treatment of the depressed phase of bipolar disorder, whereas other sodium channel blocking antiepileptic drugs are not. In addition, lamotrigine shares few side-effects with other, unrelated anticonvulsants known to inhibit sodium channels, which further emphasizes its unique properties. Lamotrigine is inactivated by hepatic glucuronidation.

Lumiracoxib has several distinctive features. Its structure is different from that of other COX-2 inhibitors, such as celecoxib: lumiracoxib is an analogue of diclofenac (one chlorine substituted by fluorine, the phenylacetic acid has another methyl group in meta position), making it a member of the arylalkanoic acid class of NSAIDs; it binds to a different site on the COX-2 receptor than do other COX-2 inhibitors; it is the only acidic coxib; and has the highest COX-2 selectivity of any NSAID. Since its original approval, lumiracoxib has been withdrawn from the market in several countries, mostly due to hepatotoxicity concerns. It has never been approved for use in the United States."

Tubocurarine (also known as D-tubocurarine or DTC) is a skeletal muscle relaxant in the category of non-depolarizing neuromuscular-blocking drugs, used adjunctively in anesthesia to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation. Unlike a number of other related skeletal muscle relaxants, it is now rarely considered clinically to facilitate endotracheal intubation. Tubocurarine is classified as a long-duration, antagonist for Nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It is the active agent of curare. Currently, tubocurarine is rarely used as an adjunct for clinical anesthesia because safer alternatives, such as cisatracurium and rocuronium, are available.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Gadopentetic_acid	Gadopentetic acid	55466	DB00789	RH248G8V27	86050-77-3				"Gadopentetic acid is one of the trade names for a gadolinium -based MRI contrast agent, usually administered as a salt of a complex of gadolinium with DTPA (diethylenetriaminepentacetate) with the chemical formula A2[Gd(DTPA)(H2O)]; when cation A is the protonated form of the amino sugar meglumine the salt goes under the name ""Gadopentetate dimeglumine"". It was described in 1981 and introduced as the first MRI contrast agent in 1987. It is used to assist imaging of blood vessels and of inflamed or diseased tissue where the blood vessels become 'leaky'. It is often used when viewing intracranial lesions with abnormal vascularity or abnormalities in the bloodâ€“brain barrier. It is usually injected intravenously. Gd-DTPA is classed as an acyclic, ionic gadolinium contrast medium. Its paramagnetic property reduces the T1 relaxation time (and to some extent the T2 and T2* relaxation times) in NMR, which is the source of its clinical utility. Marketed as Magnevist by Bayer Schering Pharma, it was the first intravenous contrast agent to become available for clinical use, and is in widespread use around the world. Similar contrast agents are Dotarem manufactured by Guerbet, MultiHance and ProHance manufactured by Bracco, Omniscan manufactured by GE Healthcare, and OptiMARK manufactured by Mallinckrodt. Gadolinium based agents may cause a toxic reaction known as nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) in patients with severe kidney problems. Compared to other gadolinium-based MRI contrast agents, Gadopentetate dimeglumine (Gd-DTPA2-) chelates allow delayed Gadolinium-enhanced Magnetic Resonance of Cartilage (dGEMRIC). The unique charge characteristic of this complex allows researchers to inversely measure spin-lattice relaxation times as they are related to the concentration of proteoglycan aggregates and charged glycosaminoglycan side chains in articular cartilage."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glatiramer_acetate	Glatiramer acetate	3081884	DB05259	5M691HL4BO	147245-92-9				Glatiramer acetate (also known as Copolymer 1, Cop-1, or Copaxone - as marketed by Teva Pharmaceuticals) is an immunomodulator drug currently used to treat multiple sclerosis. It is a random polymer of four amino acids found in myelin basic protein, namely glutamic acid, lysine, alanine, and tyrosine, and may work as a decoy for the immune system. Glatiramer acetate is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for reducing the frequency of relapses, but not for reducing the progression of disability. Observational studies, but not randomized controlled trials, suggest that it may reduce progression of disability. Although the clinical definition of multiple sclerosis requires two or more episodes of symptoms and signs, glatiramer acetate is approved for treatment after single episodes. It is also used to treat relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. It is administered by subcutaneous injection.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Grepafloxacin	Grepafloxacin	72474	DB00365	L1M1U2HC31	119914-60-2				"Grepafloxacin hydrochloride (trade name Raxar, Glaxo Wellcome) was a oral broad-spectrum quinoline antibacterial agent used to treat bacterial infections. Grepafloxacin was withdrawn world wide from markets owing to its side effect of lengthening the QT interval on the electrocardiogram, leading to cardiac events and sudden death. GlaxoSmithKline marketed Raxar at doses of 200 milligrams, 400 milligrams and 600 milligrams. Records filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) showed that Raxar was cited as a suspect in the reported deaths of 13 patients. There were four deaths associated with patients who took Raxar in 600-milligram doses within the clinical trials submitted with the New Drug Application (NDA) in 1997. The package insert approved by the FDA stated that ""there were no deaths or permanent disabilities"" among those who took Raxar in 400-milligram doses. It was the FDAâ€™s position that none of the noted fatalities ""was shown to be attributable to Raxar. "" On Oct. 27, 1999, GlaxoSmithKline removed Raxar from clinical use citing to the fact that Raxar's effect on ""QT interval prolongation"" was unacceptably risky. Other drugs within this class (i.e. sparfloxacin, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, gatifloxacin, gemifloxacin) have also been associated with QT interval prolongation, resulting in sudden death of the patient."

It was brought to market by Hoechst Marion Roussel and marketed under various brand names, including Seldane in the United States, Triludan in the United Kingdom, and Teldane in Australia. According to its manufacturer, terfenadine had been used by over 100 million patients worldwide as of 1990. It was superseded by fexofenadine in the 1990s due to the risk of a particular type of disruption of the electrical rhythms of the heart. Terfenadine is a prodrug, generally completely metabolized to the active form fexofenadine in the liver by the enzyme cytochrome P450 CYP3A4 isoform. Due to its near complete metabolism by the liver immediately after leaving the gut, terfenadine normally is not measurable in the plasma. Terfenadine itself, however, is cardiotoxic at higher doses, while its major active metabolite is not. Toxicity is possible after years of continued use with no previous problems as a result of an interaction with other medications such as erythromycin, or foods such as grapefruit. The addition of, or dosage change in, these CYP3A4 inhibitors makes it harder for the body to metabolize and remove terfenadine. In larger plasma concentrations, it may lead to toxic effects on the heart's rhythm.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trastuzumab	Trastuzumab		DB00072	P188ANX8CK	180288-69-1		Intravenous	Unknown, possibly reticuloendothelial system.	Trastuzumab (INN; trade names Herclon, Herceptin) is a monoclonal antibody that interferes with the HER2/neu receptor. Its main use is to treat certain breast cancers. The HER receptors are proteins that are embedded in the cell membrane and communicate molecular signals from outside the cell to inside the cell, and turn genes on and off. The HER proteins stimulate cell proliferation. In some cancers, notably certain types of breast cancer, HER2 is over-expressed, and causes cancer cells to reproduce uncontrollably. The original studies of trastuzumab showed that it improved overall survival in late-stage (metastatic) breast cancer from 20.3 to 25.1 months. In early stage breast cancer, it reduces the risk of cancer returning after surgery by an absolute risk of 9.5%, and the risk of death by an absolute risk of 3% however increases serious heart problems by an absolute risk of 2.1% which may resolve if treatment is stopped. Trastuzumab is controversial partly because of its cost, as much as $54,000 per year, and while certain private insurance companies in the U.S. and government health care systems in Canada, England and elsewhere have refused to pay for trastuzumab for certain patients, some companies have since accepted trastuzumab treatment as a covered preventative treatment. Trastuzumab is also being studied for the treatment of other cancers. It has been used with some success in women with uterine papillary serous carcinomas that overexpress HER2/neu.

A common starting dose is 15 mg IV, equivalent to 10 mg of morphine hydrochloride. Piritramide is commonly used for the treatment of postoperative pain. Piritramide was discovered at Janssen Pharmaceutica in 1960 and is currently manufactured and distributed within continental Europe and some other places by Janssen-Cilag. Piritramide is available in tablets and ampoules of sterile solution for injection by all routes, and is used in Patient Controlled Analgesia units. In addition to PCA, piritramide is most often used in post-operative situations and emergency departments; some of its properties would seem to lend it well to chronic pain control as well. It is one of the longer-lasting opioids and has a plasma half-life of 3 to 12 hours. Piritramide tends to cause less respiratory depression than morphine and can take a while to have full effect especially if taken by mouth. Piritramide is also known as pirinitramide. Its closest chemical relatives amongst well-known drugs are diphenoxylate (Lomotil) and bezitramide (Burgodin). Piritramide's most common trade name is Dipidolor and it is used most heavily in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany. Piritramide is a strong opioid and therefore is regulated much the same as morphine in all known jurisdictions. It was never introduced in the United States and is therefore a Schedule I/Narcotic controlled substance. It is listed under international treaties and other laws such as the German BetÃ¤ubungsmittelgesetz, the Austrian Suchtgiftmittelgesetz, the Opium Laws of various other European countries, Canadian controlled substances act, UK Misuse of Drugs Act of 1971, and equivalents elsewhere. Strangely enough, bezitramide, which is not currently marketed in the United States is a Schedule II/Narcotic controlled substance. Piritramide has a small but dedicated community of recreational users and it has the street names P, Dip (rhymes with ""pipe"") and Pierrette."

It relieves itching caused for example by dry skin conditions such as eczema. The substance is also used as a sclerosant, an irritant injected to treat varicose veins, under the trade names Asclera and Aethoxysklerol. Polidocanol causes fibrosis inside varicose veins, occluding the lumen of the vessel, and reducing the appearance of the varicosity. The FDA has approved polidocanol injections for the treatment of small varicose (less than 1Â mm in diameter) and reticular veins (1 to 3Â mm in diameter). Polidocanol works by damaging the cell lining of blood vessels, causing them to close and eventually be replaced by other types of tissue.

The proposed indication for tafenoquine is for treatment of the hypnozoite stages of Plasmodium vivax that are responsible for relapse of these malaria species even when the blood stages are successfully cleared. This is only now achieved by administration of daily primaquine for 14 days. The main advantage of tafenoquine is that it has a long half-life (2â€“3 weeks) and therefore a single treatment may be sufficient to clear hypnozoites. The shorter regimen has been described as an advantage. Like primaquine, tafenoquine causes haemolysis in people with G-6-P deficiency. Indeed the long half-life of tafenoquine suggests that particular care should be taken to ensure that individuals with severe deficiency do not receive the drug. The dose of tafenoquine has not been firmly established, but for the treatment of Plasmodium vivax malaria, a dose of 800Â mg over three days has been used.

PMA has been occasionally found in tablets labeled as MDMA (colloquially known as ""ecstasy""), although its effects are markedly different compared to those of MDMA. PMA is commonly synthesized from anethole, the flavor compound of anise and fennel, mainly because the starting material for MDMA, safrole, has become less available due to law enforcement action, causing illicit drug manufacturers to use anethole as an alternative. Once thought to be a human invention, recent research suggests PMA occurs as a trace alkaloid in plants including certain Acacia species and Browningia candelaris."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/4-Methylpregabalin	4-Methylpregabalin	10197908			313651-25-1				"4-Methylpregabalin is a drug developed by Pfizer and related to pregabalin, which similarly acts as an analgesic with effectiveness against difficult to treat ""atypical"" pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain. The effectiveness of pregabalin and its older relative gabapentin against these kind of pain syndromes (which tend to respond poorly to other analgesic drugs) has led to their widespread use, and these drugs have subsequently been found to be useful for many other medical applications, including as anticonvulsants, muscle relaxants, anxiolytics and mood stabilisers. However these drugs are still of relatively low potency, and scientists have struggled for years to come up with an improvement on pregabalin, with increasing pressure to find a suitably improved replacement before the patent on pregabalin expires in 2013. While it was determined that the mechanism of action involves modulation of the Î±2Î´ calcium channel subunits, derivatives that appeared to be more potent and effective than pregabalin at this target when tested in vitro, repeatedly turned out to be weak or inactive when tested in animals. Eventually it was discovered that pregabalin is actively transported across the bloodâ€“brain barrier by the system L neutral amino acid transporter protein, which usually functions to transport certain amino acids, including leucine, valine and isoleucine, into the brain. This explained the previous failures, as most alterations to the pregabalin molecule which increase affinity for the Î±2Î´ channels and therefore increase apparent potency in the test tube, were found to also dramatically reduce binding to the system L transporter, and with no assisted transport into the brain, bloodâ€“brain barrier penetration was minimal and the drugs were inactive in animals. However after extensive searching it was discovered that one enantiomer of the relatively simple derivative 4-methylpregabalin, was both 4x higher in binding affinity to Î±2Î´ channels than pregabalin, and also retained similar affinity for the system L transporter. This was tested in animals and as hoped, was found to have similar effectiveness to pregabalin as an analgesic and with around 2-3x the potency. It remains unclear at this stage whether (3R,4R)-4-methylpregabalin will now be further developed for medical use in humans however, given the recent development of several competing drugs from the same family which are much further advanced in clinical trials."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fenfluramine/phentermine	Fenfluramine/phentermine						Oral		The drug combination fenfluramine/phentermine, usually called fen-phen, was an anti-obesity treatment that utilized two anorectics. Fenfluramine was marketed by American Home Products (later known as Wyeth) as Pondimin, but was shown to cause potentially fatal pulmonary hypertension and heart valve problems, which eventually led to its withdrawal and legal damages of over $13 billion. Phentermine was not shown to have harmful effects. Fenfluramine acts as a serotonin releasing agent, phentermine as a norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin releasing agent.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/HPV_vaccine	HPV vaccine						injection		The human papilloma virus (HPV) vaccine prevents infection with certain species of human papillomavirus associated with the development of cervical cancer, genital warts, and some less common cancers. Two HPV vaccines are currently on the market: Gardasil and Cervarix. Both vaccines protect against the two HPV types (HPV-16 and HPV-18) that cause 70% of cervical cancers, 80% of anal cancers, 60% of vaginal cancers, and 40% of vulvar cancers. These HPV types also cause most HPV induced oral cancers, and some other rare genital cancers. Gardasil also protects against the two HPV types (HPV-6 and HPV-11) that cause 90% of genital warts. Both vaccines have been shown to prevent potentially precancerous lesions of the cervix. Gardasil has been shown to prevent potential precursors to anal, vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancers. HPV vaccines are expected to protect against HPV induced cancers of these areas as well as HPV induced oral cancers. The World Health Organization (WHO), as well as public health officials in Australia, Canada, Europe, and the United States recommend vaccination of young women against HPV to prevent cervical cancer, and to reduce the number of treatments for cervical cancer precursors. Worldwide, HPV is the most common sexually transmitted infection in adults. For example, more than 80% of American women will have contracted at least one strain of HPV by age fifty. Although most women infected with genital HPV will not have complications from the virus, worldwide there are an estimated 529,000 new cases of cervical cancer and 275,000 deaths per year. About 85 percent of cancers, and eighty percent of deaths from cervical cancer occur in developing countries. In the United States, most of the approximately 11,000 cervical cancers found annually occur in women who have never had a Pap smear, or not had one in the previous five years. HPV is also the cause of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN). CIN is a precursor to cervical cancer, and is painful and costly to treat. It is not known how many women worldwide are diagnosed with CIN. Since the vaccine only covers some high-risk types of HPV, experts still recommend that women get regular Pap smear screening even after vaccination. HPV vaccination is approved for use in males in many areas. In addition to protecting their partners from cervical cancer, vaccination can protect males against anal cancer, and may prevent other HPV associated cancers. Gardasil can also protect males against genital warts. HPV vaccination has been recommended for males in the United States, where vaccine uptake among women has been low. Vaccination is also recommended in populations at higher risk for HPV associated cancers, such as men who have sex with men and those with compromised immune response.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/BI_224436	BI 224436								BI 224436 is an investigational new drug under development for the treatment of HIV infection. BI 224436 is the first non-catalytic site integrase inhibitor (NCINI). It inhibits HIV replication via binding to a conserved allosteric pocket of the HIV integrase enzyme. This makes the drug distinct in mechanism of action compared to raltegravir and elvitegravir, which bind at the catalytic site. In October 2011, Gilead Sciences purchased exclusive rights to develop BI 224436 and several related compounds under investigation in Boehringer Ingelheimâ€™s noncatalytic site integrase inhibitor program.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rosiglitazone	Rosiglitazone	77999	DB00412	05V02F2KDG	122320-73-4		Oral	Hepatic	Rosiglitazone (trade name Avandia, GlaxoSmithKline) is an antidiabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It works as an insulin sensitizer, by binding to the PPAR receptors in fat cells and making the cells more responsive to insulin. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) as a stand-alone drug or in combination with metformin (trade name Avandamet) or with glimepiride (trade name Avandaryl). First released in 1999, annual sales peaked at approximately $2.5bn in 2006, but declined after the drug was found to increase risk of heart attacks. The drug's patent expired in 2012. Concerns about rosiglitazone's adverse effects has reduced its use despite the benefits it offers in treating diabetes. Adverse effects caused by rosiglitazone are currently the subject of over 13,000 lawsuits against GSK. As of July 2010, GSK has agreed to settlements on more than 11,500 of these suits. The drug is controversial and is estimated to have caused 83,000 heart attacks in the United States alone. Some reviewers have recommended rosiglitazone be taken off the market, but a Food and Drug Administration panel disagreed, and it remains available in the U.S. , subject to significant restrictions. From November 18, 2011, the federal government will not allow Avandia to be sold without a prescription from certified doctors. Patients will be required to be informed of the risks associated with its use, and the drug will be required to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies. In Europe, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended in September 2010 that the drug be suspended from the European market. However, patients currently taking rosiglitazone are advised to discuss alternative options during their next physician appointment. In New Zealand, rosiglitazone was withdrawn from the market in April 2011.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethinyl_estradiol	Ethinyl estradiol	5991	DB00977	423D2T571U	57-63-6		Oral, transdermal	http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Ethinyl estradiol (EE), also sometimes written as ethinylestradiol, ethynyl estradiol, or ethinyl oestradiol, is a derivative of 17Î²-estradiol (E2), the major endogenous estrogen in humans. EE is an orally bioactive estrogen used in many formulations of combined oral contraceptive pills. It is one of the most commonly used medications for this purpose. Transdermal ethinyl estradiol carries a greater risk of clot formation and venous thromboembolism than 17 beta estradiol, which some have theorized to be related to different amounts of hepatic metabolism after absorption. The same contraindications and precautions apply for EE as with other estrogen medications. Estinyl was a preparation of EE alone that was used for the management of menopausal symptoms and female hypogonadism. EE is released into the environment as a xenoestrogen from the urine and feces of people who take it as a medication. The major concern with unopposed estrogen is of endometrial cancer. As such, the medication is generally prescribed with progesterone in the setting of birth control.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clorotepine	Clorotepine	1238		E65W20MU7A	13448-22-1		Oral		Clorotepine, also known as octoclothepin or octoclothepine, is a very potent atypical neuroleptic and central depressant of the tricyclic series which was derived from perathiepin in 1965 and soon thereafter marketed in the Czech Republic by Spofa for the treatment of schizophrenic psychosis. It is known to have high affinity for the D1, D2, D3, D4, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, 5-HT6, 5-HT7, Î±1A-adrenergic, Î±1B-adrenergic, Î±1D-adrenergic, and H1 receptors, where it has been it has been confirmed to act as an antagonist at most sites (and likely is as such at all of them based on structure-activity relationships), and it also blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine via inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter. Due to its very potent activity at the D2 receptor, along with tefludazine, clorotepine was used as the basis for developing a 3-dimensional (3D) pharmacophore for D2 receptor antagonists.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Amitriptylinoxide	Amitriptylinoxide	20313		TYR2U59WMA	4317-14-0		Oral		Amitriptylinoxide (Amioxid, Ambivalon, Equilibrin), or amitriptyline N-oxide, is a tricyclic antidepressant (TCA) which was introduced in Europe in the 1970s for the treatment of depression. Amitriptylinoxide is both an analogue and metabolite of amitriptyline, and has similar effects as well as equivalent efficacy as an antidepressant. However, it has a faster onset of action and fewer adverse effects, including reduced drowsiness, sedation, anticholinergic symptoms like dry mouth, sweating, and dizziness, orthostatic hypotension, and cardiotoxicity. In receptor binding assays, amitripylinoxide was found to have generally equivalent pharmacology to amitriptyline, acting as a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, serotonin receptor antagonist, and H1 receptor antagonist, among other properties, but with approximately 60-fold lower affinity for the Î±1-adrenergic receptor, and the weakest affinity of any of the TCAs analyzed for the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clocapramine	Clocapramine	2793		6EEL1GB72K	47739-98-0		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		Clocapramine (Clofekton), also known as 3-chlorocarpipramine, is an atypical antipsychotic of the imidobenzyl class which was introduced in Japan in 1974 by Yoshitomi for the treatment of schizophrenia. In addition to psychosis, clocapramine has also been used to augment antidepressants in the treatment of anxiety and panic. Clocapramine has been reported to act as an antagonist of the D2, 5-HT2A, Î±1-adrenergic, and Î±2-adrenergic receptors, and does not inhibit the reuptake of either serotonin or norepinephrine. It has also been shown to have affinity for the Ïƒ receptors. Clocapramine's affinity for the 5-HT2A receptor is greater than that for the D2 receptor and it has a lower propensity for inducing extrapyramidal symptoms compared to typical antipsychotics, thus underlying its atypical nature. In several clinical trials, clocapramine has been compared to other neuroleptic agents. Against haloperidol, though there was no significant difference in efficacy at the end of the study, clocapramine tended to be superior in alleviating motor retardation, alogia, and thought disorder, and also produced fewer side effects. Against sulpiride, clocapramine demonstrated more favorable effects in the treatment of both positive and negative symptoms, including motor retardation, delusions, hallucinations, and social isolation, though it produced more side effects. Against timiperone, clocapramine showed lower efficacy against both positive and negative symptoms and produced more side effects such as dyskinesia, insomnia, constipation, and nausea. Clocapramine has been implicated in at least one fatality, a suicide in which there were two self-inflicted stab wounds and an overdose of clocapramine as well as three other antipsychotics was taken. The stab wounds could not explain the death, and thus, it was attributed to multiple drug toxicity instead.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Linaclotide	Linaclotide	16158208		N0TXR0XR5X	851199-59-2		Oral		Linaclotide (marketed under the trade name Linzess) is an experimental peptide agonist of guanylate cyclase 2C that is undergoing clinical trials for use in treating abdominal pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) accompanied by constipation. The drug also looks promising in the treatment of gastroparesis, chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIPO), and inertia coli as well. The drug was developed by Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Linaclotide was approved by the FDA on August 30, 2012 for the treatment of chronic idiopathic constipation and to treat irritable bowel syndrome with constipation (IBS-C) in adults. It became available in US pharmacies on December 17, 2012. That same month, it was forecast by market research firm Decision Resources to achieve blockbuster status by 2021. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) estimates that as many as 20% of Americans may experience signs of irritable bowel syndrome, with approximately one-third of those affected experiencing constipation often accompanied by abdominal pain, affecting as many as 10 million Americans. Laxatives can assist with constipation but don't treat pain, while use of opiates to treat pain can aggravate constipation. While low-cost laxatives and pain killers would likely be tried first, linaclotide targets both associated conditions in a once-daily pill and could be used if standard treatments are unsuccessful in treating symptoms, though it would likely cost as much as several dollars per day.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pasireotide	Pasireotide	9941444		98H1T17066	396091-73-9		Subcutaneous		Pasireotide (SOM230, trade name Signifor) is an orphan drug approved in the U.S. and Europe for the treatment of Cushing's disease in patients who fail or are ineligible for surgical therapy. It was developed by Novartis. Pasireotide is a somatostatin analog which has a 40-fold increased affinity to somatostatin receptor 5 than other somatostatin analogs. The drug showed therapeutical potential in a recent study (PASPORT-CUSHINGS B2305) where 162 patients were treated with either 2x 600 Âµg or 2x 900 Âµg pasireotide s.c. daily. The effectiveness of the treatment was checked by the UFC-value (urinary free cortisol) after six months of treatment. The mean reduction of UFC after six months was 47.9%, which also lead to amelioration of clinical symptoms such as blood pressure, cholesterol value, and weight loss. Pasireotide was recommended by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Advisory Committee for approval in the United States on November 7, 2012. The then FDA approved Pasireotide on December 16, 2012 as part of a priority review, fast-track process for orphan drugs.

It was first developed in 1966 by Wyeth Laboratories, and tested for use as an agent to encourage weight gain and for the treatment of short stature, but was never marketed commercially because of fears that it might be toxic. It subsequently showed up in urine tests on athletes in competition in the early 2000s. Norboletone was found to have been brought to the market by the chemist Patrick Arnold, of the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO), an American nutritional supplement company. It is reputed to have been the active ingredient in the original formulation of the ""undetectable"" steroid formulation known as ""The Clear"" before being replaced by the more potent drug tetrahydrogestrinone. In 2002, Don Catlin, the founder and then-director of the UCLA Olympic Analytical Lab, identified norboletone for the first time in an athleteâ€™s urine sample. In the same year, U.S. bicycle racer Tammy Thomas was caught using it and was banned from her sport. The following year, Catlin identified and developed a test for tetrahydrogestrinone (THG), the second reported designer anabolic sampleâ€”a key development in the BALCO Affair. Norboletone is on the World Anti-Doping Agency's list of prohibited substances, and is therefore banned from use in most major sports."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bitopertin	Bitopertin			Q8L6AN59YY	845614-11-1				Bitopertin (GLYT-1; RO-4917838; RG1678) is a drug under development intended to be used in combination with antipsychotics for the treatment of persistent negative symptoms or sub-optimally controlled positive symptoms associated with schizophrenia. If licensed, bitopertin would represent the first in a new class of treatments for this patient group. Bitopertin is a glycine transporter type 1 (GlyT1) inhibitor that increases levels of the neurotransmitter glycine by inhibiting its reuptake from the synaptic cleft. Glycine acts as a required co-agonist along with glutamate at N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Dysfunction of NMDA receptors may play a key role in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and modulation of glutamatergic signalling via increased concentrations of glycine in the synaptic cleft may help potentiate NMDA receptor function and improve the symptoms of schizophrenia. Bitopertin is administered orally at 10mg or 20mg once daily for 56 weeks. Roche is co-developing RG1678 globally with Chugai. In a Phase II proof-of-concept study patients on RG1678 experienced a significant improvement in the change of the Negative Symptom Factor Score from baseline within 8 weeks (from -4.86 in the placebo group to -6.65 in the treatment group, p<0.05, per-protocol population). In addition, 83% of patients on RG1678 described an improvement of negative symptoms on the CGI-I1 vs 66% on placebo (p<0.05, per-protocol population).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lithium_(medication)	Lithium (medication)	28486	DB01356		7439-93-2		Oral, parenteral		Lithium carbonate, in ionic or salt form, is commonly used as a psychiatric medication. A number of chemical salts of lithium are used medically as mood-stabilizing drugs, primarily in the treatment of bipolar disorder, where they have a role in the treatment of depression and particularly of mania, both acutely and in the long term. As a mood stabilizer, lithium is probably more effective in preventing mania than depression, and reduces the risk of suicide in bipolar patients. In depression alone (unipolar disorder), lithium can be used to augment other antidepressants. Lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), sold under several trade names, is the most commonly prescribed, while lithium citrate (Li3C6H5O7) is also used in conventional pharmacological treatments. Lithium sulfate (Li2SO4) has been presented as an alternative. Upon ingestion, lithium becomes widely distributed in the central nervous system and interacts with a number of neurotransmitters and receptors, decreasing norepinephrine (noradrenaline) release and increasing serotonin synthesis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Kelatorphan	Kelatorphan	123982	DB08040		92175-57-0				Kelatorphan is a drug which acts as a powerful and complete inhibitor of nearly all of the enzymes responsible for catabolism of the endogenous enkephalins, including neutral endopeptidase (NEP), dipeptidyl peptidase III (DPP3), aminopeptidase N (APN), and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In mice, with the intracerebroventricular co-administration of a 50 Âµg dose of kelatorphan (this route is necessary because kelatorphan is incapable of crossing the blood-brain-barrier) hence alongside exogenous Met Met]enkephalin (ED50 approximately 10 ng), it potentiated the analgesic effects of the latter by 50,000 times. Kelatorphan also displays potent antinociceptive effects alone, and does not depress respiration, although at high doses it actually increases it.

Î±-methylacetylfentanyl was sold briefly on the black market in the early 1980s, before the introduction of the Federal Analog Act which for the first time attempted to control entire families of drugs based on their structural similarity rather than scheduling each drug individually as they appeared. Î±-methylacetylfentanyl is made with the same synthetic route as Î±-methylfentanyl, but by substituting the relatively common acetic anhydride for the more difficult to obtain chemical propionic anhydride in the synthesis. Î±-methylacetylfentanyl has similar effects to fentanyl. Side effects of fentanyl analogues are similar to those of fentanyl itself, which include itching, nausea and potentially serious respiratory depression which can be life-threatenng.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/6-APT	6-APT	14964398			?		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mouth		6-(2-Aminopropyl)tetralin (6-APT), also sometimes called tetralinylaminopropane (TAP), is an entactogen drug of the amphetamine class which acts as a selective serotonin releasing agent (SSRA). It has IC50 values of 121 nM, 6,436 nM, and 3,371 nM for inhibiting the reuptake of serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, respectively. Though it possesses an appreciable in vitro profile, in animal drug discrimination studies it was not found to substitute for MMAI or amphetamine and to only partially substitute for MBDB. This parallels Alexander Shulgin's finding that EDMA is inactive, and appears to indicate that the pharmacokinetics of both EDMA and 6-APT may not be favorable.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brivanib_alaninate	Brivanib alaninate	11154925			649735-63-7		Oral		Brivanib alaninate also known as BMS-582664 is an investigational, anti-tumorigenic drug for oral administration. The drug is being developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma or HCC (also called malignant hepatoma), the most common type of liver cancer. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a primary cancer of the liver and is more common in men than in women. The disease occurs mostly in people who have scarring of the liver or after infection with hepatitis B or hepatitis C. Symptoms include pain and swelling in the abdomen, weight loss, weakness, loss of appetite and nausea. Hepatocellular carcinoma is a severe and life-threatening disease that is associated with poor overall survival. While the choice of treatment depends mainly on how advanced the disease is, the only proven therapies to cure the cancer is surgery to remove the tumor and liver transplantation, but these therapies can only be carried out in very few patients. Other treatments include chemotherapy and immunotherapy. Radiofrequency ablation and ethanol injection are also used to remove small tumors. As a result of poor liver function, metastases, or both, only 10% to 20% of patients undergo surgery. In patients having surgery, the 5-year survival rate is only 25% to 50%. Several chemotherapeutic agents have been evaluated for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma. Doxorubicin, the most widely used agent in HCC, has shown a 4% to 10.5% response rate in patients with HCC. Studies have shown that the overall response (OR) rate, but not overall survival (OS), doubles when doxorubicin was given in combination with cisplatin, IFN, and 5-fluorouracil. The multitargeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib, which inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, raf, c-kit, and flt-3, has been shown to inhibit HCC-induced proliferation and angiogenesis. Sorafenib has also been shown to provide a significant improvement in OS in patients with HCC. Based on these results, researchers concluded that this class of agents may be effective in the treatment of HCC. Brivanib alaninate also inhibits VEGFR and fibroblast growth factor receptors (FGFR), which is known to play a major role in the etiopathogenesis of HCC. To date, brivanib alaninate has been investigated in 29 studies, including more than 4,000 patients around the world.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ospemifene	Ospemifene	3036505			128607-22-7		Oral		Ospemifene (commercial name Osphena produced by Shionogi) is an oral medication indicated for the treatment of dyspareunia - pain during sexual intercourse - encountered by some women, more often in those who are post-menopausal. Ospemifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) acting similarly to an estrogen on the vaginal epithelium, building vaginal wall thickness which in turn reduces the pain associated with dyspareunia. The medication was approved by the FDA in February 2013. The boxed warning of the medication indicates that the drug may thicken the endometrium which could lead to unusual bleeding and endometrial cancer. The risk of thrombotic and hemorrhagic strokes is given as 0.72 and 1.45 per 1,000 women, while that of deep vein thrombosis is estimated to be 1.45 per 1,000 women. These risks are lower than those seen with estrogen-alone therapy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Emoxypine	Emoxypine	114681			2364-75-2		Oral & IV		Emoxypine (2-ethyl-6-methyl-3-hydroxypyridine), also known as Mexidol or Mexifin when used as the succinate salt, is an antioxidant manufactured in Russia by Pharmasoft Pharmaceuticals. Its chemical structure resembles that of pyridoxine (a type of vitamin B). It is not approved for any medical use in the United States or Europe. Emoxypine was first synthesized by L.D. Smirnov and K.M. Dumayev, then studied and developed in the Institute of Pharmacology, Russian Academy of Medical Sciences and National Scientific Center of Bioactive Substances Safety. In Russia, emoxypine has a wide range of applications in medical practice. It purportedly exercises anxiolytic, anti-stress, anti-alcohol, anticonvulsant, nootropic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory action. Emoxypine presumably improves cerebral blood circulation, inhibits thrombocyte aggregation, lowers cholesterol levels, has cardioprotective and antiatherosclerotic action. Emoxypine is deemed useful as an anxiolytic medication with few side effects (i.e. no sedation, impairment, tolerance or addition potential) compared to benzodiazepines. {{medcn} Emoxypine's mechanism of action is believed to be its antioxidant and membrane-protective effects with the following key components: Emoxypine effectively inhibits free radical oxidation of biomembrane lipids, reacts to peroxide radicals of lipids primary and hydroxyl radical of peptides Increases the activity of antioxidant enzymes, specifically that of superoxiddismutase, responsible for the formation and consumption of lipid peroxides and active oxygen forms Inhibits free radicals during the synthesis of prostaglandin catalyzed cyclooxygenase and lipoxygenase, increases the correlation prostocyclin/ thromboxane A2 and blocks the leukotriene formation Increases the content of polar fraction of lipids (phosphatidyl serine and phosphatidyl inositol) and reduces the cholesterol/phospholipids ratio which proves its lipid-regulatory properties; shifts structure transition into the low temperature zones, that is provokes the reduction of membrane viscosity and the increase of its fluidity, increases lipid-protein ration. Modulates the activity of membrane-bound enzymes: phosphodiesterase, cyclic nucleotides, adenylate cyclase, aldoreductase, acetylcholinesterase. Modulates the receptor complexes of the brain membranes, i.e. benzodiazepine, GABA, acetylcholine receptors by increasing their binding ability. Stabilizes biomembranes, i.e. membrane structures of blood cells - erythrocites and thrombocites during their haemolysis or mechanical injury accompanied by the formation of free radicals. Emoxypine has a pronounced hypolipidemic action; it reduces the total cholesterol and low-viscosity lipoprotein level in blood and increases the high-viscosity lipoprotein concentration. The preparation improves cellular energy metabolism by activating the energy-synthesizing function of mitochondrion. Changes the monoamine level and increases the dopamine content in the brain. One study determined the effectiveness of emoxypine in 205 patients with clinical manifestations of lumbosacral radiculopathy (LSR). Patients were divided into two groups, and further were divided into subgroups depending on the presence of motor disturbances. All patients received a course of conventional medical treatment and physiotherapy; main group additionally received emoxypine. Thereafter, clinical-neurological control of long-term results of treatment in subgroups of patients was performed. The results showed that the use of emoxypine in the combined therapy of patients with LSR lead to significant and persistent reduction of severity of pain syndrome and rapid recovery of function of spinal roots and peripheral nerves compared with conventional therapy.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Omecamtiv_mecarbil	Omecamtiv mecarbil	11689883			873697-71-3		http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intravenous_therapy		Omecamtiv mecarbil, previously codenamed CK-1827452, is a cardiac specific myosin activator. It is clinically tested for its role in the treatment of left ventricular systolic heart failure. Systolic heart failure is characterised as a decreased cardiac output (<40% ejection fraction), due to decreased stroke volume, resulting in the inability to meet the metabolic demands of the body. The loss of contraction is caused by a reduced number of effective actin-myosin cross bridges in the left ventricular myocytes. One possible underlying mechanism is altered signal transduction that interferes with excitation-contraction coupling. A decreased cardiac output causes peripheral hypotension and activation of the sympathetic nervous system. This in turn stimulates the cardiac myocytes excessively, eventually leading to left ventricular hypertrophy, characteristic of chronic heart failure. Some symptoms of systolic heart failure are fatigue, peripheral oedema, dyspnoea, exercise intolerance and breathlessness. Current inotropic drug therapies such as dobutamine, are palliative and not a cure. They also cause many adverse effects including arrhythmias related to increased myocardical oxygen consumption, desensitization of adrenergic receptors and altering intracellular calcium levels. Thus systolic heart failure is considered malignant, however the novel mechanism of Omecamtiv Mecarbil is a hopeful long-term resolution.

Ciprefadol is a mixed agonistâ€“antagonist at Î¼-opioid receptors and can partly block the effects of morphine at low doses, though at higher doses it acts more like a full agonist. It is also a potent Îº-opioid agonist, unlike the corresponding N-methyl and N-phenethyl derivatives which are reasonably Î¼-selective agonists.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Drinabant	Drinabant	10278470			358970-97-5				Drinabant is a drug that acts as a selective CB1 receptor antagonist, which was under investigation varyingly by Sanofi-Aventis as a treatment for obesity, schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and nicotine dependence. Though initially studied as a potential treatment for a variety of different medical conditions, Sanofi-Aventis eventually narrowed down the therapeutic indications of the compound to just appetite suppression. Drinabant reached phase IIb clinical trials for this purpose in the treatment of obesity but was shortly thereafter discontinued, likely due to the observation of severe psychiatric side effects including anxiety, depression, and thoughts of suicide in patients treated with the now-withdrawn rimonabant, another CB1 antagonist that was also under development by Sanofi-Aventis.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mefway_(18F)	Mefway (18F)	11963740			943962-60-5				Mefway is a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist used in medical research, usually in the form of mefway as a positron emission tomography (PET) radiotracer. It is closely related to the research compound WAY-100,635. The compound adds a fluoromethyl group to the cyclohexyl ring of WAY-100,635. There are two isomers with regard to the cyclohexane ring, of which the trans conformation has the higher 5-HT1A specificity. In one study the uptake and retention of mefway (F) was found to be similar to that found for C-WAY-100,635. Head-to-head comparison of mefway (F) and C-WAY-100,635 have been evaluated. Since C-WAY-100,635 is the current â€˜gold standardâ€™ and difficult to synthesize, a suitable fluorine-18 replacement as in mefway is highly desired. The ability to separately measure dissociation constant, KD and receptor density Bmax has been shown to be of potential value rather than simply comparing binding potential, Bnd. Multiple injection mefway PET experiments can be used for the in-vivo measurement of 5-HT1A receptor density. Imaging studies of mefway on in vivo and ex vivo rat brains indicate that the substance binds to the known 5-HT1A receptor regions including the dorsal raphe. These findings support that the dorsal raphe is measurable in rat PET studies.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lometraline	Lometraline	34789			39951-65-0				Lometraline is a drug which is an aminotetralin derivative. A structural modification of the investigative neuroleptic pinoxepin, lometraline was originally patented by Pfizer as an antipsychotic, tranquilizer, and antiparkinsonian agent (likely as an anticholinergic). However, it was instead later studied as a potential antidepressant and/or anxiolytic agent, but clinical studies revealed no psychoactivity at the doses used and further investigation was suspended. However, further experimental modifications of the chemical structure of lometraline directly resulted in the discovery of tametraline, a potent inhibitor of the reuptake of dopamine and norepinephrine, which in turn led to the discovery of the now widely popular antidepressant sertraline, which, remarkably, acts contrarily as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).

It has neuroprotective and anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, antinociceptive and sedative / hypnotic effects in animal models. Pilot human clinical trials in the early 1960s showed that HA-966 appeared to benefit patients with tremors of extrapyramidal origin. The two enantiomers of HA-966 have differing pharmacological activity. The glycine/N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist activity is specific to the R-(+) enantiomer, whereas the sedative and ataxic effects are specific to the S-(-) enantiomer. R-(+)-HA-966 did not induce drug-appropriate responding in animals trained to discriminate phencyclidine (PCP) from saline, suggesting that the glycine receptor ligand R-(+)-HA-966 has a significantly different behavioral profile than drugs affecting the ion channel of the NMDA receptor complex. S-(-)-HA-966 has been described as a ""Î³-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB)-like agent"" and a ""potent y-butyrolactone-like sedative"", but it shows no affinity for the GABAB receptor (GABABR)."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Butyrfentanyl	Butyrfentanyl	621174			1169-70-6				Butyr-fentanyl, often abbreviated as B-F, or Butyrylfentanyl (not to be confused with 3-methylfentanyl) is a potent short-acting synthetic opioid analgesic drug. It is an analogue of fentanyl with around 1/4 the potency of fentanyl. One of first signs of this drug can be found in document written by The College on Problem of Drug Dependence, where it is mentioned under the position 10486 as N-butyramide fentanyl analog. This document also states that the article describing its clinical effects (analgesic studies, m-, d-, k-Opioid receptor binding and in vitro measures of drug efficacy, antinociceptive and narcotic properties) was published in 1987. It is an agonist at mu opioid receptors. Butyrfentanyl is called first opioid research chemical (RC, called also designer drug). It has no clinical applications yet. According to different drug users' forums, it's used by drug abusers. Its effects include: anaesthesia and analgesia, but weaker than in case of fentanyl; euphoria, greater than in case of fentanyl. Butyrfentanyl doesn't cause that great risk of respiratory depression, as fentanyl does, and it is not scheduled. All there properties made it an attractive reseach chemical.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Samidorphan	Samidorphan	11667832			852626-89-2				Samidorphan (ALKS 33) is a selective opioid antagonist which blocks the Î¼-opioid receptor, but without affecting the Î´-opioid or Îº-opioid receptors. It has been investigated for the treatment of alcoholism and cocaine addiction, showing similar efficacy to naltrexone but possibly with reduced side effects. However it has attracted much more attention as part of the combination product ALKS 5461, where samidorphan is mixed with the mixed mu agonist / kappa antagonist buprenorphine, as an antidepressant. Buprenorphine has shown antidepressant effects in some human studies, thought to be because of its antagonist effects at the kappa opioid receptor, but has not been further developed for this application because of its mu opioid agonist effects and consequent abuse potential. By combining buprenorphine with samidorphan to block the mu agonist effects, the combination acts more like a selective kappa antagonist, and produces only antidepressant effects, without typical mu opioid effects being evident.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glucarpidase	Glucarpidase				0009074-87-7		IV		Glucarpidase (Voraxaze) is a FDA-approved intravenous drug for the treatment of elevated levels of methotrexate (defined as 1 micromol/L) during treatment of cancer patients who have impaired kidney function (and thus can't reduce the drug to safe levels sufficiently after the drug has been given). Glucarpidase is an enzyme that inactivates methotrexate rapidly after injection. Because this agent reduces systemic levels of methotrexate and could therefore interfere with efficacy, it is not recommended for use in patients with normal or only slightly impaired kidney function or in whom serum levels are normal. The main antidote for methotrexate overdoses prior to the approval of this drug were high doses of folinic acid. However, this agent was not always sufficient at preventing renal failure due to methotrexate. Glucarpidase also degrades folinic acid so the two should not be used together (within two hours of one another). Glucarpidase, a recombinant form of the bacterial enzyme carboxypeptidase G2 converts methotrexate into glutamate and 2,4-diamino-N(10)-methylpteroic acid. These are generally much less toxic and are excreted largely by the liver. One case series in children has found that high-dose methotrexate therapy can be resumed after an instance of methotrexate-induced acute kidney injury successfully treated with glucarpidase. So far adverse effects that have been reported have been mild and include numbness, tingling, flushing, nausea, vomiting, itching, and headache.

The antibody is engineered for enhanced affinity to the CD20 antigen on B-lymphocytes, increased antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), and for improved treatment of low-affinity FcÎ³RIIIa allotypes. Phase I/II trials in relapsed/refractory follicular lymphoma have been completed in the United States (US) and Japan, and a Phase I trial was conducted in US rheumatoid arthritis patients. Phase III development in relapsed follicular lymphoma patients is underway. Many patients relapse following currently available treatments, and a significant need for new effective treatment exists, particularly for patients with low-affinity FcÎ³RIIIa allotypes. In pre-clinical studies, ocaratuzumab was shown to have 13 to 20 fold greater affinity for CD20 and 6 fold more potent ADCC as compared to rituximab. Additional development in other oncology and rheumatology indications will also be pursued, as well as subcutaneous formations for patient convenience.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/GLYX-13	GLYX-13				117928-94-6				GLYX-13 is a partial agonist of the NMDA receptor - specifically at the glycine binding site. It has been shown to enhance memory and learning in both young adult and learning-impaired, aging rat models. GLYX-13, a tetrapeptide, readily crosses the blood brain barrier and has been shown to increase Schaffer collateral-CA1 LTP in vitro. In concert with a learning task it has also been shown to elevate gene expression of hippocampal NR1, a subunit of the NMDA receptor, in 3-month-old rats. Neuroprotective effects have also been demonstrated in Mongolian Gerbils by delaying the death of CA1, CA3, and dentate gyrus pyramidal neurons under glucose and oxygen-deprived conditions. Preclinical data indicates that GLYX-13 has a therapeutic index of 500 or more, onset within 20Â minutes of administration, and produces antidepressant-like effects lasting approximately two weeks following administration. Currently under development by Naurex Inc, the compound recently completed phase II trials as a treatment for those resistant or non-responsive to traditional antidepressants. Additionally, GLYX-13 has demonstrated antinociceptive activity, which is of particular interest, as both competitive and noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonists are ataxic at analgesic doses, while GLYX-13 and other glycine subunit ligands are able to elicit analgesia at sub-ataxic doses.

It was invented by chemists Edward Knaus, Brent Warran and Theodore Ondrus in 1981. This compound was found to be 5.4x more potent than morphine in the phenylquinone writhing test when administered subcutaneously. However, due to its structural differences from other opioid drugs it would be difficult to represent as being ""substantially similar in chemical structure"" to any other controlled drug. It has never been studied in humans, but would be expected to produce effects similar to those of other potent opioid agonists, including strong analgesia, sedation, euphoria, constipation, itching and respiratory depression which could be harmful or fatal. Tolerance and dependence are expected to develop rapidly based on the potency of the drug."

Structurally it closely resembles cannabinoid compounds from patent WO 2003/035005 but with an indole core instead of indazole, and a simple pentyl chain on the indole 1-position. Pharmacological testing determined SDB-001 to have an IC50 of 175nM at CB1, only slightly less potent than JWH-018 which had an IC50 of 169nM, but over four times more tightly binding than AKB48, which had an IC50 of 824nM. The first published synthesis and pharmacological evaluation of SDB-001 revealed that it acts as a full agonist at CB1 (EC50 = 34 nM) and CB2 receptors (EC50 = 29 nM).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/RO4491533	RO4491533	11158623							RO-4491533 is a drug developed by Hoffmann-La Roche which acts as a potent and selective negative allosteric modulator for group II of the metabotropic glutamate receptors, being equipotent at mGluR2 and mGluR3 but without activity at other mGluR subtypes. In animal studies, RO-4491533 produced antidepressant effects and reversed the effects of the mGluR2/3 agonist LY-379,268 with similar efficacy but slightly lower potency than the mGluR2/3 antagonist LY-341,495. A number of related compounds are known, with similar effects in vitro and a fairly well characterized structure-activity relationship.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/RO5166017	RO5166017	25016538							RO-5166017 is a drug developed by Hoffmann-La Roche which acts as a potent and selective agonist for the Trace amine-associated receptor 1, with no significant activity at other targets. This is important for the study of the TAAR1 receptor, as while numerous other compounds are known which act as TAAR1 agonists, such as methamphetamine, MDMA and 3-iodothyronamine, all previously known TAAR1 agonists are either weak and rapidly metabolized, or have strong pharmacological activity at other targets, making it very difficult to assess which effects are due to TAAR1 activation. The discovery of RO-5166017 allows purely TAAR1 mediated effects to be studied, and in animal studies it was shown to prevent stress-induced hyperthermia and block dopamine-dependent hyperlocomotion, as well as blocking the hyperactivity which would normally be induced by an NMDA antagonist.

It was discovered as an active metabolite of the synthetic 5-HT7 agonists LP-12 and LP-211, and unexpectedly turned out to be a similarly potent agonist with selectivity approaching that of the parent molecules, despite its much simpler structure.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/3,4-Ethylidenedioxyamphetamine	3,4-Ethylidenedioxyamphetamine	130542							3,4-Ethylidenedioxyamphetamine (EIDA) is a substituted derivative of methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), which was developed by David Nichols and coworkers, in the course of research to determine the bulk tolerance around the benzodioxole portion of the MDA molecule. EIDA was found to produce similar effects to MDA in animals but with less than half the potency, while the isopropylidinedioxy derivative (IPIDA, IDA) did not substitute for MDA and instead had sedative and convulsant effects. This shows limited bulk tolerance at this position and makes it likely the activity of EIDA will reside primarily in one enantiomer, although only the racemic mix has been studied as yet.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/CECXG	CECXG	44329042							CECXG (3'-ethyl-LY-341,495) is a research drug which acts as a potent and selective antagonist for the group II metabotropic glutamate receptors, with reasonable selectivity for mGluR3. While it is some five times less potent than LY-341,495 at mGluR3, it has 38x higher affinity for mGluR3 over mGluR2, making it one of the few ligands available that is able to distinguish between these two closely related receptor subtypes. 40px This pharmacology-related article is a stub.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/CTEP	CTEP	11646823							CTEP is a research drug developed by Hoffmann-La Roche that acts as a selective allosteric antagonist of the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype mGluR5, binding with nanomolar affinity and over 1000x selectivity over all other receptor targets tested. In animal studies it was found to have a high oral bioavailability and a long duration of action, lasting 18 hours after a single dose, giving it considerably improved properties over older mGluR5 antagonists such as MPEP and fenobam.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/EPPTB	EPPTB	25175634							EPPTB (RO-5212773) is a drug developed by Hoffmann-La Roche which acts as a potent and selective antagonist for the Trace amine-associated receptor 1, with no significant activity at other targets. EPPTB is one of the first selective antagonists developed for TAAR1, and has been used to demonstrate an important role for TAAR1 in regulation of dopaminergic signalling in the limbic system. Unfortunately while EPPTB has high affinity for the mouse TAAR1, it has much lower affinity for rat and human TAAR1, which limits its use in research. While the human and mouse forms of TAAR1 have similar functions and bind similar ligands, the actual binding affinities of individual ligands often vary significantly between the two versions of the receptor.

Like the related compound herkinorin, 2-ethoxymethyl salvinorin B is made from salvinorin B, which is most conveniently made from salvinorin A by deacetylation, as while both salvinorin A and salvinorin B are found in the plant Salvia divinorum, salvinorin A is present in larger quantities. Salvinorin B ethoxymethyl ether has a Ki of 0.32 nM at the Îº-opioid receptor, and around 3,000 times selectivity over the Î¼- and Î´-opioid receptors, making it one of the most potent and selective kappa agonists yet discovered. In animal studies it fully substituted for salvinorin A and the synthetic kappa agonist U-69593, and was active at doses as low as 0.005Â mg/kg. Human bioassays found the compound to be active at 50Â Î¼g.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Salvinorin_B_methoxymethyl_ether	Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether	11407876							Salvinorin B methoxymethyl ether (2-Methoxymethyl salvinorin B), also known by the name 'Symmetry', is a semi-synthetic analogue of the natural product salvinorin A which is used in scientific research.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nitrosoprodenafil	Nitrosoprodenafil								"Nitrosoprodenafil (a.k.a. mutaprodenafil and nitroprodenafil) is a designer drug found in ""herbal"" aphrodisiac products, which is a novel nitrosated analogue of sildenafil (Viagra). It has an innovative structure which acts as a prodrug, breaking down in the body to release both the PDE5 inhibitor aildenafil as well as free nitric oxide, which have powerfully synergistic effects. This dual mechanism of action has never been exploited by conventional pharmaceutical companies because of the risks involved; usually combining PDE5 inhibitors with nitric oxide releasers like amyl nitrite is contraindicated as it can cause a precipitous drop in blood pressure that can potentially result in death. Nitrosamines are also generally avoided in drug development as they can often be hepatotoxic, so while the combined mechanisms of action are likely to be effective, this drug also has severe risks of toxicity. Shortly after Venhuis et al. published the suggested structure for nitrosoprodenafil it was contested by Demizu et al. who suggested the structure was an azathioprine / aildenafil hybrid. This newly suggested structure was dubbed 'mutaprodenafil' because of the structural similarity with the mutagenic azathioprine. The final confirmation of the azathioprine / aildenafil hybrid was provided by Sakamoto et al. who prepared crystals for X-ray analysis. Although Sakamoto et al. support the name 'mutaprodenafil' they prefer to use 'nitroprodenafil' instead."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taliglucerase_alfa	Taliglucerase alfa								Taliglucerase alfa, commercially known as Elelyso, is a plant-derived enzyme developed by Protalix and Pfizer. The enzyme is a recombinant glucocerebrosidase used to treat Gaucherâ€™s Disease and is the first plant-made pharmaceutical to win approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Expression of proteins in plant cell culture is highly efficient, does not require post-expression modification of the protein, and is not susceptible to contamination by agents such as viruses that are pathological to humans. Using transgenic carrot cells produces a lower cost alternative, and preclinical studies show that the enzyme was well tolerated by patients.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tetanus_vaccine	Tetanus vaccine								Tetanus vaccine is a vaccine composed of inactivated tetanus toxins. This vaccine is immunogenic not pathogenic and is used to prevent an individual from contracting tetanus. Tetanus, also known as lockjaw, is a disease caused by the bacteria Clostridium tetani which enters the body through open wounds and releases a poison called tetanospasmin. This is a potentially deadly disease because the poison attacks the nervous system blocking nerve signals from the spinal cord to and from the muscles. However this disease is preventable through injecting multiple doses of vaccines and administering the recommended booster shot every ten years.

The pharmacological properties of this compound have not been formally studied or reported in the scientific literature, but it is presumably a cannabinoid agonist as it was found alongside a structurally related compound AB-FUBINACA which had previously been reported as a cannabinoid agonist in a 2009 Pfizer patent.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/ADB-FUBINACA	ADB-FUBINACA								ADB-FUBINACA is a designer drug identified in synthetic cannabis blends in Japan in 2013. ADB-FUBINACA is unprecedented in the scientific literature, and no CAS number has been assigned to its structure. ADB-FUBINACA appears to be the product of rational drug design, since it differs from AB-FUBINACA only by the replacement of the iso-propyl group with a tert-butyl group, a substitution that is likely to have little effect on bioactivity. The stereochemistry of the tert-butyl side-chain is unresolved. Nothing is known of the pharmacological activity of ADB-FUBINACA in humans or other animals.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thiambutenes	Thiambutenes								The Thiambutenes are a family of opioid analgesic drugs developed at the British research laboratory of Burroughs-Wellcome in the late 1940s. The parent compound thiambutene has no analgesic effects, but several compounds from this group are analgesics with around the same potency as morphine. Notable compounds include dimethylthiambutene, diethylthiambutene, ethylmethylthiambutene, pyrrolidinylthiambutene and piperidylthiambutene. Of these, ethylmethylthiambutene is the most potent, with 1.3x the potency of morphine, pyrrolidinylthiambutene is the least potent at 0.7x, and the rest are all around the same potency as morphine. Diethylthiambutene has been the most widely used, mainly in veterinary medicine. All of these compounds produced anticholinergic and antihistamine side effects, except for two of the weaker compounds diallylthiambutene and morpholinylthiambutene. They also all have a chiral centre around the alpha carbon (where the R1 group is attached) and so have two stereoisomers, with the dextro isomer being the more potent in all cases, although both isomers are active. Three of these compounds are explicitly listed as illegal drugs under UN convention, diethylthiambutene, dimethylthiambutene and ethylmethylthiambutene, and so are illegal throughout the world, but the rest will only be illegal in countries such as the USA, Australia and New Zealand that have laws equivalent to the Federal Analog Act.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/JD5037	JD5037								JD5037 is an antiobesity drug candidate which acts as a peripherally-restricted cannabinoid inverse agonist at CB1 receptors. It is very selective for the CB1 subtype, with a Ki of 0.35nM, >700-fold higher affinity than it has for CB2 receptors. In animal studies, JD5037 does not readily cross the blood brain barrier and thus is not expected to produce the psychiatric side effects in humans which led to the withdrawal of rimonabant from the market. Its antiobesity effects are believed to be mediated by blockade of peripheral CB1 receptors, resulting in decreased leptin expression and secretion and increased leptin clearance by the kidneys. In obese mice given the drug, the resulting resensitization to leptin levels produced decreased food intake, weight loss, and normalized responses to glucose and insulin. JD5037 is covered in the following US Patents issued to Jenrin Discovery: 8,088,809 (1/3/12)), 7,666,889 (2/23/10), 7,482,470 (1/27/09).
