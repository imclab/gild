http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abducens_nerve	Abducens nerve	A08.800.800.120.030	The abducens nerve or abducent nerve (the sixth cranial nerve, also called the sixth nerve or simply VI) is a somatic efferent nerve that controls the movement of a single muscle, the lateral rectus muscle of the eye, in humans. In most other mammals it also innervates the musculus retractor bulbi, which can retract the eye for protection. Homologous abducens nerves are found in all vertebrates except lampreys and hagfishes. The human CN VI is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic pons.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Accessory_nerve	Accessory nerve	A08.800.800.120.060	In anatomy, the accessory nerve is a nerve that controls specific muscles of the shoulder and neck. As part of it was formerly believed to originate in the brain, it is considered a cranial nerve. Based on its location relative to other such nerves, it is designated the eleventh of twelve cranial nerves, and is thus abbreviated CN XI. Traditional descriptions of the accessory nerve divide it into two parts: a spinal part and a cranial part. But because the cranial component rapidly joins the vagus nerve and serves the same function as other vagal nerve fibers, modern descriptions often consider the cranial component part of the vagus nerve and not part of the accessory nerve proper. Thus in contemporary discussions of the accessory nerve, the common practice is to dismiss the cranial part altogether, referring to the accessory nerve specifically as the spinal accessory nerve. The spinal accessory nerve provides motor innervation from the central nervous system to two muscles of the neck: the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the trapezius muscle. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, while the trapezius muscle has several actions on the scapula, including shoulder elevation and adduction of the scapula. Range of motion and strength testing of the neck and shoulders can be measured during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Limited range of motion or poor muscle strength are suggestive of damage to the spinal accessory nerve, which can result from a variety of causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. The accessory nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1â€“C6.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blastocyst	Blastocyst	A16.254.085	The blastocyst is a structure formed in the early gestation of vertebrates. It is preceded by the morula. It possesses an inner cell mass (ICM), or embryoblast, which subsequently forms the embryo, and an outer layer of cells, or trophoblast, surrounding the inner cell mass and a fluid-filled cavity known as the blastocoele. The human blastocyst comprises 70-100 cells. Blastocyst formation begins at day 5 after fertilization in humans.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Central_retinal_artery	Central retinal artery	A07.231.114.765	The central retinal artery (retinal artery) branches off the ophthalmic artery, running inferior to the optic nerve within its dural sheath to the eyeball.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorda_tympani	Chorda tympani	A08.800.800.120.250.120	The chorda tympani is a nerve that branches from the facial nerve (cranial nerve VII) inside the facial canal, just before the facial nerve exits the skull via the stylomastoid foramen. It serves the taste buds in the front of the tongue, runs through the middle ear, and carries taste messages to the brain. The chorda tympani is part of one of three cranial nerves that are involved in taste. The taste system involves a complicated feedback loop, with each nerve acting to inhibit the signals of other nerves. The chorda tympani appears to exert a particularly strong inhibitory influence on other taste nerves, as well as on pain fibers in the tongue. When the chorda tympani is damaged, its inhibitory function is disrupted, leading to less inhibited activity in the other nerves.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choroid_plexus	Choroid plexus	A08.186.211.276.298	The choroid plexus is a structure in the ventricles of the brain where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is produced. The choroid plexus consists of modified ependymal cells. It should be noted that CSF is recycled (flushed) 4 times per day in order to clean out metabolites and toxins like beta amyloid. Hence the choroid plexus must produce about 500 milliliters of CSF daily (or 20.83 ml per hour).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cingulate_cortex	Cingulate cortex	A08.186.211.577.330	The cingulate cortex is a part of the brain situated in the medial aspect of the cortex. It includes the cortex of the cingulate gyrus, which lies immediately above the corpus callosum, and the continuation of this in the cingulate sulcus. The cingulate cortex is usually considered part of the limbic lobe. It receives inputs from the thalamus and the neocortex, and projects to the entorhinal cortex via the cingulum. It is an integral part of the limbic system, which is involved with emotion formation and processing, learning, and memory. The combination of these three functions makes the cingulate gyrus highly influential in linking behavioral outcomes to motivation (e.g. a certain action induced a positive emotional response, which results in learning). This role makes the cingulate cortex highly important in disorders such as depression and schizophrenia. It also plays a role in executive function and respiratory control.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Circle_of_Willis	Circle of Willis	A07.231.114.228.351	The Circle of Willis (also called Willis' Circle, Loop of Willis, cerebral arterial circle, and Willis Polygon) is a circulatory anastomosis that supplies blood to the brain and surrounding structures. It is named after Thomas Willis (1621â€“1675), an English physician.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Claustrum	Claustrum	A08.186.211.730.885.105	The claustrum is a thin, irregular, sheet of neurons which is attached to the underside of the neocortex in the center of the brain. It is suspected to be present in the brains of all mammals. The claustrum is a fraction of a millimetre to a few millimetres deep, and is a vertical curved sheet of subcortical gray matter oriented sagittally between the white matter tracts of the external capsule and extreme capsule. The claustrum is lateral to the putamen and medial to the insular cortex and is considered by some sources to be part of the basal ganglia. There are lateral and medial tracts connecting the claustrum to many parts of the cortex and perhaps to the hippocampus, the amygdala, and the caudate nucleus (connections with subcortical centers are a matter of debate). One of the interesting features of the claustrum is the uniformity in the types of cells, indicating a uniform type of processing by all claustral neurons. Though organized into modality specific regions, the claustrum contains a great deal of longitudinal connections between its neurons that could serve to synchronize the entire anterior-posterior extent of the claustrum. Francis Crick and Christof Koch have compared the claustrum to the conductor of an orchestra. The different parts of the cortex must play in harmony or else the result is a cacophony of sounds instead of a beautiful symphony. The claustrum may be involved in widespread coordination of the cerebral cortex, using synchronization to achieve a seamless timescale between both the two cortical hemispheres and between cortical regions within the same hemisphere, resulting in the seamless quality of conscious experience.

It is derived from mesoderm. The other two meningeal layers are the pia mater and the arachnoid mater. The dura surrounds the brain and the spinal cord and is responsible for keeping in the cerebrospinal fluid. The name dura mater is derived from the Latin ""tough mother"", a loan translation of Arabic Ø£Ù… Ø§Ù„Ø¯Ù…Ø§Øº Ø§Ù„ØµÙﾁÙŠÙ‚Ø© (umm al-dimÄﾁgh aá¹£-á¹£afÄ«qah), literally thick mother of the brain, matrix of the brain. and is also referred to by the term ""pachymeninx"" (plural ""pachymeninges"").

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Entorhinal_cortex	Entorhinal cortex	A08.186.211.577.710.225	The entorhinal cortex (EC) (ento = interior, rhino = nose, entorhinal = interior to the rhinal sulcus) is an area of the brain located in the medial temporal lobe and functioning as a hub in a widespread network for memory and navigation. The EC is the main interface between the hippocampus and neocortex. The EC-hippocampus system plays an important role in autobiographical/declarative/episodic memories and in particular spatial memories including memory formation, memory consolidation, and memory optimization in sleep. The EC is also responsible for the pre-processing (familiarity) of the input signals in the reflex nictitating membrane response of classical trace conditioning, the association of impulses from the eye and the ear occurs in the entorhinal cortex.

It is made of dense irregular connective tissue and usually contains multiple nerve fascicles as well as blood vessels which supply the nerve. Smaller branches of these blood vessels penetrate into the perineurium. The epineurium is formed when the spinal nerve leaves the vertebral canal via the intervertebral foramen and two layers of the spinal meninges invaginate the nerveâ€”arachnoid and duraâ€”forming a ""dural sleeve"" which is the epineurium. A type of surgery that involves the epineurium is epineurial repair."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foramen_magnum	Foramen magnum	A02.835.232.781.572.434	In anatomy, the foramen magnum is a large opening in the occipital bone of the cranium. It is one of the several oval or circular apertures in the base of the skull, through which the medulla oblongata (an extension of the spinal cord) enters and exits the skull vault. Apart from the transmission of the medulla oblongata and its membranes, the foramen magnum transmits the spinal accessory nerve, vertebral arteries, the anterior and posterior spinal arteries, the membrana tectoria and alar ligaments.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foramen_ovale_(heart)	Foramen ovale	A07.541.459	In the fetal heart, the foramen ovale, also foramen Botalli, ostium secundum of Born or falx septi, allows blood to enter the left atrium from the right atrium. It is one of two fetal cardiac shunts, the other being the ductus arteriosus (which allows blood that still escapes to the right ventricle to bypass the pulmonary circulation). Another similar adaptation in the fetus is the ductus venosus. In most individuals, the foramen ovale closes at birth. It later forms the fossa ovalis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_leg	Human leg	A01.378.610.500	The human leg is the entire lower extremity or limb of the human body, including the foot, thigh and even the hip or gluteal region; however, the precise definition in human anatomy refers only to the section of the lower limb extending from the knee to the ankle. Legs are used for standing, walking, jumping, running, kicking, and similar activities, and constitute a significant portion of a person's mass.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_lung	Lungs	A04.411	"The human lungs are the organs of respiration in humans. Humans have two lungs, a right lung and a left lung. The right lung consists of three lobes while the left lung is slightly smaller consisting of only two lobes (the left lung has a ""cardiac notch"" allowing space for the heart within the chest). Together, the lungs contain approximately 2,400 kilometres of airways and 300 to 500 million alveoli, having a total surface area of about 70 square metres (8,4 x 8,4 m) in adultsÂ â€” roughly the same area as one side of a tennis court. Furthermore, if all of the capillaries that surround the alveoli were unwound and laid end to end, they would extend for about 992 kilometres . Each lung weighs 1.1 kilograms, therefore making the entire organ about 2.3 kilograms . The trachea divides into two bronchi (one for each side) at the level of T4. This junction is also known as the carina. The conducting zone contains the trachea, the bronchi, the bronchioles, and the terminal bronchioles The respiratory zone contains the respiratory bronchioles, the alveolar ducts, and the alveoli. The conducting zone and the respiratory stuffers (but not the alveoli) are made up of airways. The conducting zone has no gas exchange with the blood, and is reinforced with cartilage in order to hold open the airways. The conducting zone warms the air to 37 Â°C and humidifies the air. It also cleanses the air by removing particles via cilia located on the walls of all the passageways. The lungs are surrounded by the rib cage. The respiratory zone is the site of gas exchange with blood. The sympathetic nervous system via noradrenaline acting on the beta receptors causes bronchodilation. The parasympathetic nervous system via acetylcholine, which acts on the M-3 muscarinic receptors, maintains the resting tone of the bronchiolar smooth muscle. This action is related, although considered distinct from bronchoconstriction. Many other non-autonomic nervous and biochemical stimuli, including carbon dioxide and oxygen, are also involved in the regulation process. The pleural cavity is the potential space between the parietal pleura, lining the inner wall of the thoracic cage, and the visceral pleura lining the lungs. The lung parenchyma is strictly used to refer solely to alveolar tissue with respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts and terminal bronchioles. However, it often includes any form of lung tissue, also including bronchioles, bronchi, blood vessels and lung interstitium."

At rest, it lies at the level of the base of the mandible in the front and the third cervical vertebra (C3) behind. Unlike other bones, the hyoid is only distantly articulated to other bones by muscles or ligaments. The hyoid is anchored by muscles from the anterior, posterior and inferior directions, and aids in tongue movement and swallowing. The hyoid bone provides attachment to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the tongue above, the larynx below, and the epiglottis and pharynx behind. Its name is derived from the Greek word hyoeides meaning ""shaped like the letter upsilon""."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nasolacrimal_duct	Nasolacrimal duct	A09.371.463.640	The nasolacrimal duct (sometimes called the tear duct) carries tears from the lacrimal sac into the nasal cavity. The opening of the nasolacrimal duct into the inferior nasal meatus is partially covered by a mucosal fold (valve of Hasner or plica lacrimalis). Excess tears flow through nasolacrimal duct which drains into the inferior nasal meatus. This is the reason the nose starts to run when a person is crying or has watery eyes from an allergy, and why one can sometimes taste eye drops. Like the lacrimal sac, the duct is lined by stratified columnar epithelium containing mucus-secreting goblet cells, and is surrounded by connective tissue. Obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, known as dacryostenosis, leads to the excess overflow of tears called epiphora. A congenital obstruction can cause cystic expansion of the duct and is called a dacrocystocele or Timo cyst. Persons with dry eye conditions can be fitted with punctal plugs that seal the ducts to limit the amount of fluid drainage and retain moisture. The canal containing the nasolacrimal duct is called the nasolacrimal canal.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Neurolemma	Neurolemma	Neurilemma	Neurolemma (also known as neurilemma or sheath of Schwann) is the outermost nucleated cytoplasmic layer of Schwann cells that surrounds the axon of the neuron. It forms the outermost layer of the nerve fiber in the peripheral nervous system. The neurolemma is underlain by the basal lamina (referred to as the medullary sheath in the included illustrations). In CNS, axons are myelinated by oligodendrocytes, thus lack neurolemma. The myelin sheaths of Oligodendrocytes do not have neurolemma because excess cytoplasm is directed centrally toward the Oligodendrocyte cell body. A neurilemoma is a tumor of the neurilemma.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spermatid	Spermatid	A05.360.490.890.860	The spermatid is the haploid male gametid that results from division of secondary spermatocytes. As a result of meiosis, each spermatid contains only half of the genetic material present in the original primary spermatocyte. Spermatids are connected by cytoplasmic material and have superfluous cytoplasmic material around their nuclei. When formed, early round spermatids must undergo further maturational events to develop into spermatozoa, a process termed spermiogenesis (also termed spermeteliosis). The spermatids begin to grow a living thread, develop a thickened mid-piece where the mitochondria become localised, and form an acrosome. Spermatid DNA also undergoes packaging, becoming highly condensed. The DNA is packaged firstly with specific nuclear basic proteins, which are subsequently replaced with protamines during spermatid elongation. The resultant tightly packed chromatin is transcriptionally inactive.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebral_subluxation	Spinal nerve roots	A08.800.800.720.725	"In chiropractic, vertebral subluxation is a set of signs and symptoms of the spinal column. Those chiropractors who assert this concept (specifically, ""straight chiropractors"") also add a visceral component to the definition. Chiropractors maintain that a vertebral subluxation complex is a dysfunctional biomechanical spinal segment which is fixated. Chiropractors additionally assert that the dysfunction actively alters neurological function, which in turn, is believed to lead to neuromusculoskeletal and visceral disorders. The WHO acknowledges this difference between the medical and chiropractic definitions of a subluxation. Medical doctors only refer to ""significant structural displacements"" as subluxations, whereas chiropractors suggest that a dysfunctional segment, whether displaced significantly or not, should be referred to as a subluxation. This difference has been noted in the proceedings of the chiropractic profession's Mercy Center Consensus Conference: ""The chiropractic profession refers to this concept as a 'subluxation'. This use of the word subluxation should not be confused with the term's precise anatomic usage, which considers only the anatomical relationships. "" The chiropractic vertebral subluxation complex has been a source of controversy since its inception in 1895 due to its metaphysical origins and claims of far reaching effects on health and disease. Although some chiropractic associations and colleges support the concept of subluxation, many in the chiropractic profession reject it and shun the use of this term as a diagnosis In the United States and in Canada the term nonallopathic lesion is commonly used in place of subluxation as a diagnosis, and is considered a more accurate descriptor of lesions that chiropractors treat most commonly."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zona_pellucida	Zona pellucida	A05.360.490.690.950	The zona pellucida (plural zonae pellucidae, also egg coat or pellucid zone) is a glycoprotein membrane surrounding the plasma membrane of an oocyte. It is a vital constitutive part of the oocyte, external but of essential importance to it. The zona pellucida first appears in unilaminar primary oocytes. It is secreted by both the oocyte and the follicular cells. This structure binds spermatozoa, and is required to initiate the acrosome reaction. In the mouse (the best characterised mammalian system), the zona glycoprotein, ZP3, is responsible for sperm binding, adhering to proteins on the sperm plasma membrane (GalT). ZP3 is then involved in the induction of the acrosome reaction, whereby a spermatozoon releases the contents of the acrosomal vesicle. The exact characterisation of what occurs in other species has become more complicated as further zona proteins have been identified. In humans, five days after the fertilization, the blastocyst performs zona hatching; the zona pellucida degenerates and decomposes to be replaced by the underlying layer of trophoblastic cells. The zona pellucida is essential for oocyte death and fertilization. In some older texts, it has also been called zona striata and stratum lucidum (not to be confused with the stratum lucidum of the skin).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brainstem	Brainstem	A08.186.211.132	In vertebrate anatomy the brainstem (or brain stem) is the posterior part of the brain, adjoining and structurally continuous with the spinal cord. It is usually described as including the medulla oblongata (myelencephalon), pons (part of metencephalon), and midbrain (mesencephalon). Less frequently, parts of the diencephalon are included. The brain stem provides the main motor and sensory innervation to the face and neck via the cranial nerves. Though small, this is an extremely important part of the brain as the nerve connections of the motor and sensory systems from the main part of the brain to the rest of the body pass through the brain stem. This includes the corticospinal tract (motor), the posterior column-medial lemniscus pathway (fine touch, vibration sensation and proprioception) and the spinothalamic tract (pain, temperature, itch and crude touch). The brain stem also plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac and respiratory function. It also regulates the central nervous system, and is pivotal in maintaining consciousness and regulating the sleep cycle. The brain stem has many basic functions including heart rate, breathing, sleeping and eating.

It may also be involved in some cognitive functions such as attention and language, and in regulating fear and pleasure responses, but its movement-related functions are the most solidly established. The cerebellum does not initiate movement, but it contributes to coordination, precision, and accurate timing. It receives input from sensory systems of the spinal cord and from other parts of the brain, and integrates these inputs to fine tune motor activity. Because of this fine-tuning function, damage to the cerebellum does not cause paralysis, but instead produces disorders in fine movement, equilibrium, posture, and motor learning. In its anatomy, the cerebellum has the appearance of a separate structure attached to the bottom of the brain, tucked underneath the cerebral hemispheres. The surface of the cerebellum is covered with finely spaced parallel grooves, in striking contrast to the broad irregular convolutions of the cerebral cortex. These parallel grooves conceal the fact that the cerebellum is actually a continuous thin layer of tissue (the cerebellar cortex), tightly folded in the style of an accordion. Within this thin layer are several types of neurons with a highly regular arrangement, the most important being Purkinje cells and granule cells. This complex neural network gives rise to a massive signal-processing capability, but almost all of its output is directed to a set of small deep cerebellar nuclei lying in the interior of the cerebellum. In addition to its direct role in motor control, the cerebellum also is necessary for several types of motor learning, the most notable one being learning to adjust to changes in sensorimotor relationships. Several theoretical models have been developed to explain sensorimotor calibration in terms of synaptic plasticity within the cerebellum. Most of them derive from early models formulated by David Marr and James Albus, which were motivated by the observation that each cerebellar Purkinje cell receives two dramatically different types of input: On one hand, thousands of inputs from parallel fibers, each individually very weak; on the other hand, input from one single climbing fiber, which is, however, so strong that a single climbing fiber action potential will reliably cause a target Purkinje cell to fire a burst of action potentials. The basic concept of the Marr-Albus theory is that the climbing fiber serves as a ""teaching signal"", which induces a long-lasting change in the strength of synchronously activated parallel fiber inputs. Observations of long-term depression in parallel fiber inputs have provided support for theories of this type, but their validity remains controversial."

Between the epiphysis and diaphysis (the long midsection of the long bone) lies the metaphysis, including the epiphyseal plate (growth plate). At the joint, the epiphysis is covered with articular cartilage; below that covering is a zone similar to the epiphyseal plate, known as subchondral bone. The epiphysis is filled with red bone marrow, which produces erythrocytes (red blood cells).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glomerulus	Glomerulus	A05.810.453.324.359	In the kidney, a tubular structure called the nephron filters blood to form urine. At the beginning of the nephron, the glomerulus /É¡lÉ’ËˆmÉ›rÉ™lÉ™s/ is a network (tuft) of capillaries that performs the first step of filtering blood. The glomerulus is surrounded by Bowman's capsule. The blood is filtered through the capillaries of the glomerulus into the Bowman's capsule. The Bowman's capsule empties the filtrate into a tubule that is also part of the nephron. A glomerulus receives its blood supply from an afferent arteriole of the renal circulation. Unlike most other capillary beds, the glomerulus drains into an efferent arteriole rather than a venule. The resistance of these arterioles results in high pressure within the glomerulus, aiding the process of ultrafiltration, where fluids and soluble materials in the blood are forced out of the capillaries and into Bowman's capsule. A glomerulus and its surrounding Bowman's capsule constitute a renal corpuscle, the basic filtration unit of the kidney. The rate at which blood is filtered through all of the glomeruli, and thus the measure of the overall renal function, is the glomerular filtration rate (GFR).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Middle_ear	Middle ear	A09.246.397	The middle ear is the portion of the ear internal to the eardrum, and external to the oval window of the cochlea. The mammalian middle ear contains three ossicles, which couple vibration of the eardrum into waves in the fluid and membranes of the inner ear. The hollow space of the middle ear has also been called the tympanic cavity, or cavum tympani. The eustachian tube joins the tympanic cavity with the nasal cavity, allowing pressure to equalize between the middle ear and throat. The primary function of the middle ear is to efficiently transfer acoustic energy from compression waves in air to fluidâ€“membrane waves within the cochlea.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mitral_valve	Mitral valve	A07.541.510.507	The mitral valve (also known as the bicuspid valve or left atrioventricular valve) is a dual-flap (bi- from the Latin, meaning double, and mitral- from the Latin, meaning shaped like a mitre) valve in the heart that lies between the left atrium (LA) and the left ventricle (LV). The mitral valve (not to be confused with the congenital bicuspid aortic valve) and the tricuspid valve are known collectively as the atrioventricular valves because they lie between the atria and the ventricles of the heart and control the flow of blood. During diastole, a normally-functioning mitral valve opens as a result of increased pressure from the left atrium as it fills with blood. As atrial pressure increases above that of the left ventricle, the mitral valve opens. Opening facilitates the passive flow of blood into the left ventricle. Diastole ends with atrial contraction, which ejects the final 20% of blood that is transferred from the left atrium to the left ventricle. This amount of blood is known as end diastolic volume (EDV), and the mitral valve closes at the end of atrial contraction to prevent a reversal of blood flow.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Notochord	Notochord	A16.254.610	"The notochord is a flexible rod-shaped body found in embryos of all chordates. It is composed of cells derived from the mesoderm and defines the primitive axis of the embryo. In some chordates, it persists throughout life as the main axial support of the body, while in most vertebrates it becomes the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disc. The notochord is found ventral to the neural tube. Notochords were the first ""backbones"" serving as support structures in chordates such as Haikouichthys. Notochords were advantageous to primitive fish-ancestors because they were a rigid structure for muscle attachment, yet flexible enough to allow more movement than, for example, the exoskeleton of the dominant animals of that time. Embryos of vertebrates have notochords today, as it retained a key role in signalling and coordinating development even as it was lost in most adults. In most tetrapods, they eventually develop into the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral discs."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Optic_disc	Optic disc	A08.800.800.120.680.660	"The optic disc or optic nerve head is the location where ganglion cell axons exit the eye to form the optic nerve. There are no light sensitive rods or cones to respond to a light stimulus at this point. This causes a break in the visual field called ""the blind spot"" or the ""physiological blind spot"". The optic disc represents the beginning of the optic nerve and is the point where the axons of retinal ganglion cells come together. The optic disc is also the entry point for the major blood vessels that supply the retina. The optic nerve head in a normal human eye carries from 1 to 1.2 million neurons from the eye towards the brain."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Outer_ear	Outer ear	A09.246.272	The outer ear is the external portion of the ear, which consists of the pinna and external auditory meatus. It gathers sound energy and focuses it on the eardrum. One consequence of the configuration of the external ear is to selectively boost the sound pressure 30- to 100-fold for frequencies around 3Â kHz. This amplification makes humans most sensitive to frequencies in this range - and also explains why they are particularly prone to acoustical injury and hearing loss near this frequency. Most human speech sounds are also distributed in the bandwidth around 3Â kHz.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oval_window	Oval window	A09.246.631.909.551	The oval window (or vestibular window) is a membrane-covered opening which leads from the middle ear to the vestibule of the inner ear. Vibrations that come into contact with the tympanic membrane travel through the three ossicles and into the inner ear. The oval window is the intersection of the middle ear with the inner ear, and is directly contacted by the stapes; by the time vibrations reach the oval window, they have been amplified over twenty times from what they were when they contacted the tympanic membrane, a testament to the amplifying power of the middle ear. It is a reniform (kidney-shaped) opening leading from the tympanic cavity into the vestibule of the internal ear; its long diameter is horizontal, and its convex border is upward. In the recent state it is occupied by the base of the stapes, the circumference of which is fixed by the annular ligament to the margin of the foramen.

It is composed of a layer of mesothelium supported by a thin layer of connective tissue. The peritoneum both supports the abdominal organs and serves as a conduit for their blood and lymph vessels and nerves. The abdominal cavity should not be confused with the intraperitoneal space (located within the abdominal cavity, but wrapped in peritoneum). The structures within the intraperitoneal space are called ""intraperitoneal"", the structures in the abdominal cavity that are located behind the intraperitoneal space are called ""retroperitoneal"", and those structures below the intraperitoneal space are called ""subperitoneal"" or ""infraperitoneal""."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Posterior_root_of_spinal_nerve	Posterior root of spinal nerve	A08.800.800.720.725	In anatomy and neurology, the dorsal root (or posterior root) is the afferent sensory root of a spinal nerve. At the distal end of the dorsal root is the dorsal root ganglion, which contains the neuron cell bodies of the nerve fibres conveyed by the root. If the dorsal root of a spinal nerve were severed it would lead to numbness in certain areas of the body. The lateral division of the dorsal root contains lightly myelinated and unmyelinated axons of small diameter. These transmit pain and temperature sensation from the body. These fibers cross through the anterior white commissure to form the Anterior lateral system in the lateral funiculus. The medial division of the dorsal root contains myelinated axons of larger diameter. These transmit information of discriminative touch, pressure, vibration, and conscious proprioception originating from spinal levels C2 through S5. These fibers are pushed in towards the posterior medial sulcus to form the fasciculus gracilis and the fasciculus cuneatus.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renal_medulla	Renal medulla	A05.810.453.466	The renal medulla is the innermost part of the kidney. The renal medulla is split up into a number of sections, known as the renal pyramids. Blood enters into the kidney via the renal artery, which then splits up to form the arcuate arterioles. The arcuate arterioles each in turn branch into interlobular arterioles, which finally reach the glomeruli. At the glomerulus the blood reaches a highly disfavourable pressure gradient and a large exchange surface area, which forces the serum portion of the blood out of the vessel into the renal tubules. Flow continues through the renal tubules, including the proximal tubule, the Loop of Henle, through the distal tubule and finally leaves the kidney by means of the collecting duct, leading to the renal ureter. The renal medulla (Latin renes medulla = kidney middle) contains the structures of the nephrons responsible for maintaining the salt and water balance of the blood. These structures include the vasa rectae (both spuria and vera), the venulae rectae, the medullary capillary plexus, the loop of Henle, and the collecting tubule. The renal medulla is hypertonic to the filtrate in the nephron and aids in the reabsorption of water. Blood is filtered in the glomerulus by solute size. Ions such as sodium, chloride, potassium, and calcium are easily filtered, as is glucose. Proteins are not passed through the glomerular filter because of their large size, and do not appear in the filtrate or urine unless a disease process has affected the glomerular capsule or the proximal and distule tubules of the nephron.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Substantia_nigra	Substantia nigra	A08.186.211.132.659.687	"The substantia nigra is a brain structure located in the mesencephalon (midbrain) that plays an important role in reward, addiction, and movement. Substantia nigra is Latin for ""black substance"", reflecting the fact that parts of the substantia nigra appear darker than neighboring areas due to high levels of melanin in dopaminergic neurons. Parkinson's disease is characterized by the death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta. Although the substantia nigra appears as a continuous band in brain sections, anatomical studies have found that it actually consists of two parts with very different connections and functions: the pars compacta and pars reticulata. The pars compacta serves mainly as an input to the basal ganglia circuit, supplying the striatum with dopamine. The pars reticulata, on the other hand, serves mainly as an output, conveying signals from the basal ganglia to numerous other brain structures."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sweat_gland	Sweat gland	A10.336.899	"Sweat glands (also known as sudoriferous or sudoriparous glands, from Latin sudor, meaning ""sweat""), are small tubular structures of the skin that produce sweat. There are two main types of sweat glands: Eccrine sweat glands are distributed almost all over the body, though their density varies from region to region. Humans utilize eccrine sweat glands as a primary form of cooling. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Apocrine sweat glands are larger, have a different secretion mechanism, and are mostly limited to the axilla (armpits) and perianal areas in humans. Although apocrine glands contribute little to cooling in humans, they are the only effective sweat glands in hoofed animals such as the camel, donkey, horse, and cattle. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}{{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Domestic animals have apocrine glands at the base of each hair follicle but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout. Their apocrine glands, like those in humans, produce an odorless oily milky secretion evolved not to evaporate and cool but rather coat and stick to hair so odor-causing bacteria can grow on it. Eccrine glands on their foot pads, like those on palms and soles of humans, didn't evolve to cool either but rather increase friction and enhance grip. Both apocrine and eccrine sweat glands contain myoepithelial cells (from Greek myoâ€“ ""muscle""), specialized epithelial cells located between the gland cells and the underlying basal lamina. Myoepithelial cell contractions squeeze the gland and discharge the accumulated secretions. The secretory activities of the gland cells and the contractions of myoepithelial cells are controlled by both the autonomic nervous system and by the circulating hormones. Ceruminous glands, which produce ear wax, and mammary glands, which produce milk, and ciliary glands in the eyelids are considered to be modified sweat glands."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Talus_bone	Talus bone	A02.835.232.043.300.710.780	The talus bone (Latin for ankle), astragalus or ankle bone is a bone in the collection of bones in the foot called the tarsus. The tarsus forms the lower part of the ankle joint through its articulations with the lateral and medial malleoli of the two bones of the lower leg, the tibia and fibula. Within the tarsus, it articulates with the calcaneus below and navicular in front within the talocalcaneonavicular joint. Through these articulations, it transmits the entire weight of the body to the foot. The second largest of the tarsal bones, it is also one of the bones in the human body with the highest percentage of its surface area covered by articular cartilage. Additionally, it is also unusual in that it has a retrograde blood supply, i.e. arterial blood enters the bone at the distal end. In humans, no muscles attaches to the talus, unlike most bones, and it position is therefore dependent on the position on the neighbouring bones.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Taste_bud	Taste buds	A03.556.500.885.779	Taste buds contain the receptors for taste. They are located around the small structures on the upper surface of the tongue, soft palate, upper esophagus and epiglottis, which are called papillae. These structures are involved in detecting the five (known) elements of taste perception: salty, sour, bitter, sweet, and umami. Via small openings in the tongue epithelium, called taste pores, parts of the food dissolved in saliva come into contact with taste receptors. These are located on top of the taste receptor cells that constitute the taste buds. The taste receptor cells send information detected by clusters of various receptors and ion channels to the gustatory areas of the brain via the seventh, ninth and tenth cranial nerves. On average, the human tongue has 2,000â€“8,000 taste buds.

A hollow muscular, and distensible (or elastic) organ, the bladder sits on the pelvic floor. Urine enters the bladder via the ureters and exits via the urethra. Bladders occur throughout much of the animal kingdom, but are very diverse in form and in some cases are not homologous with the urinary bladder in humans. The human urinary bladder is derived in embryo from the urogenital sinus and, it is initially continuous with the allantois. In males, the base of the bladder lies between the rectum and the pubic symphysis. It is superior to the prostate, and separated from the rectum by the rectovesical excavation. In females, the bladder sits inferior to the uterus and anterior to the vagina; thus, its maximum capacity is lower than in males. It is separated from the uterus by the vesicouterine excavation. In infants and young children, the urinary bladder is in the abdomen even when empty.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Zygapophysial_joint	Zygapophysial joint	A02.835.583.979	A zygapophysial joint (zygapophyseal, apophyseal, Z-joint, or facet joint) is a synovial joint between the superior articular process of one vertebra and the inferior articular process of the vertebra directly above it. There are two facet joints in each spinal motion segment. The biomechanical function of each pair of facet joints is to guide and limit movement of the spinal motion segment. In the lumbar spine, for example, the zygapophysial joints function to protect the motion segment from anterior shear forces, excessive rotation and flexion. Zygapophyseal joints appear to have little influence on the range of side bending (lateral flexion). These functions can be disrupted by degeneration, dislocation, fracture, injury, instability from trauma, osteoarthritis, and surgery. In the thoracic spine the zygapophysial joints function to restrain the amount of flexion and anterior translation of the corresponding vertebral segment and function to facilitate rotation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fascia	Fascia	D005205	A fascia is a layer of fibrous tissue. A fascia is a structure of connective tissue that surrounds muscles, groups of muscles, blood vessels, and nerves, binding some structures together, while permitting others to slide smoothly over each other. Various kinds of fascia may be distinguished. They are classified according to their distinct layers, their functions and their anatomical location: superficial fascia, deep (or muscle) fascia, and visceral (or parietal) fascia. Like ligaments, aponeuroses, and tendons, fasciae are dense regular connective tissues, containing closely packed bundles of collagen fibers oriented in a wavy pattern parallel to the direction of pull. Fasciae are consequently flexible structures able to resist great unidirectional tension forces until the wavy pattern of fibers has been straightened out by the pulling force. These collagen fibers are produced by the fibroblasts located within the fascia. Fasciae are similar to ligaments and tendons as they are all made of collagen except that ligaments join one bone to another bone, tendons join muscle to bone and fasciae surround muscles or other structures.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pyramidal_tracts	Corticospinal tract	A08.186.854.633	The pyramidal tracts refers to both the corticospinal and corticobulbar tracts. The corticospinal tract conducts impulses from the brain to the spinal cord. It contains mostly axons originated from the motor cortex. The corticospinal tract is made up of two separate tracts in the spinal cord: the lateral corticospinal tract and the anterior corticospinal tract. The corticospinal tract also contains the Betz Cell (the largest pyramidal cells) that are not found in any other region of the body. An understanding of these tracts leads to an understanding of why one side of the body is controlled by the opposite side of the brain. The corticospinal tract is concerned specifically with discrete voluntary skilled movements, such as precise movement of the fingers and toes. The brain sends impulses to the spinal cord relaying the message. This is imperative in understanding that the left hemisphere of the brain controls the right side of the body, while the right hemisphere of the brain controls the left side of the body. The signals cross in the medulla oblongata, this process is also known as decussation. The corticobulbar tract carries information to motor neurons of the cranial nerve nuclei, rather than the spinal cord.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subclavian_artery	Subclavian artery	A07.231.114.839	In human anatomy, the subclavian arteries are two major arteries of the upper thorax (chest), below the clavicle. They receive blood from the top (arch) of the aorta. The left subclavian artery supplies blood to the left arm and the right subclavian artery supplies blood to the right arm, with some branches supplying the head and thorax. On the left side of the body, the subclavian comes directly off the arch of aorta. On the right side of the body, the subclavian arises from the relatively short brachiocephalic artery (trunk) when it bifurcates into the subclavian and the right common carotid artery. The usual branches of the subclavian on both sides of the body are the vertebral artery, the internal thoracic artery, the thyrocervical trunk, the costocervical trunk and the dorsal scapular artery. The subclavian becomes the axillary artery at the lateral border of the first rib.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sublingual_gland	Sublingual Gland	A03.556.500.760.687	The sublingual glands are salivary glands in the mouth. They lie anterior to the submandibular gland under the tongue, beneath the mucous membrane of the floor of the mouth. They are drained by 8-20 excretory ducts called the ducts of Rivinus. The largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. The sublingual gland consists mostly of Mucous acini capped with serous demilunes and is therefore categorized as a mucous gland. Most of the remaining small sublingual ducts open separately into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica fimbriata, formed by the gland and located on either side of the frenulum linguae. The chorda tympani nerve is secretomotor to the sublingual glands.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ankle	Ankle	A02.835.583.378.062	"The ankle, or talocrural region, is the region where the foot and the leg meet. The ankle includes three joints: the ankle joint proper or talocrural joint, the subtalar joint, and the Inferior tibiofibular joint. The movements produced at this joint are dorsiflexion and plantaflexion of the foot. In common usage, the term ankle refers exclusively to the ankle region. In medical terminology, ""ankle"" (without qualifiers) can refer broadly to the region or specifically to the talocrural joint. The main bones of the ankle region are the talus (in the foot), and the tibia and fibula (in the leg). The talus is also called the ankle bone. The talocrural joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula and the talus."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bronchus	Bronchus	A04.411.125	"A bronchus (plural bronchi, adjective bronchial) is a passage of airway in the respiratory tract that conducts air into the lungs. The bronchus branches into smaller tubes, which in turn become bronchioles. No gas exchange takes place in this part of the lungs. The human trachea (windpipe) divides into two main bronchi (also mainstem bronchi), the left and the right, at the level of the sternal angle and of the fifth thoracic vertebra or up to two vertebrae higher or lower, depending on breathing, at the anatomical point known as the carina. The right main bronchus is wider, shorter, and more vertical than the left main bronchus. The right main bronchus subdivides into three lobar bronchi, while the left main bronchus divides into two. The lobar bronchi divide into tertiary bronchi, also known as segmentalinic bronchi, each of which supplies a bronchopulmonary segment. A bronchopulmonary segment is a division of a lung separated from the rest of the lung by a connective tissue septum. This property allows a bronchopulmonary segment to be surgically removed without affecting other segments. There are ten segments per lung, but due to anatomic development, several segmental bronchi in the left lung fuse, giving rise to eight. The segmental bronchi divide into many primary bronchioles which divide into terminal bronchioles, each of which then gives rise to several respiratory bronchioles, which go on to divide into two to 11 alveolar ducts. There are five or six alveolar sacs associated with each alveolar duct. The alveolus is the basic anatomical unit of gas exchange in the lung. The hyaline cartilage forms an incomplete ring in the bronchi, giving them a ""D""-shaped appearance in the larger bronchi and as small plates and islands in the smaller bronchi. Smooth muscle is present continuously around the bronchi. In the mediastinum, at the level of the fourth thoracic vertebra, the trachea divides into the right and left primary bronchi. The bronchi branch into smaller and smaller passageways until they terminate in tiny air sacs called alveoli. The cartilage and mucous membrane of the primary bronchi are similar to those in the trachea. As the branching continues through the bronchial tree, the amount of hyaline cartilage in the walls decreases until it is absent in the bronchioles. As the cartilage decreases, the amount of smooth muscle increases. The mucous membrane also undergoes a transition from ciliated pseudostratified columnar epithelium to simple cuboidal epithelium to simple squamous epithelium. The alveolar ducts and alveoli consist primarily of simple squamous epithelium, which permits rapid diffusion of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Exchange of gases between the air in the lungs and the blood in the capillaries occurs across the walls of the alveolar ducts and alveoli."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carpus	Carpals	A02.835.232.087.144	Carpus is anatomical assembly connecting the hand to forearm. In human anatomy, the main role of the carpus is to facilitate effective positioning of the hand and powerful use of the extensors and flexors of the forearm, but the mobility of individual carpal bones increase the freedom of movements at the wrist. In tetrapods, the carpus is the sole cluster of bones in the wrist between the radius and ulna and the metacarpus. The bones of the carpus do not belong to individual fingers (or toes in quadrupeds), whereas those of the metacarpus do. The corresponding part of the foot is the tarsus. The carpal bones allow the wrist to move and rotate vertically.

It is the only long bone in the body that lies horizontally. It makes up part of the shoulder and the pectoral girdle and is palpable in all people, and, in people who have less fat in this region, the location of the bone is clearly visible as it creates a bulge in the skin. It receives its name from the Latin: clavicula (""little key"") because the bone rotates along its axis like a key when the shoulder is abducted."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Clitoris	Clitoris	A05.360.319.887	The clitoris is a female sexual organ present in mammals, ostriches and a limited number of other animals. In humans, the visible button-like portion is near the front junction of the labia minora (inner lips), above the opening of the urethra. Unlike the penis, the male variant of the clitoris, it usually does not contain the distal portion or opening of the urethra and is therefore not used for urination. While few animals urinate through the clitoris, the spotted hyena, which has a particularly well-developed clitoris, urinates, mates and gives birth via the organ. Other carnivorous animals, and some mammals such as lemurs and spider monkeys, also have a well-developed clitoris. The clitoris is the human female's most sensitive erogenous zone and the primary source of female sexual pleasure. In humans and other mammals, it develops from an outgrowth in the embryo called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a penis or a clitoris, depending on the presence or absence of the protein tdf, which is codified by a single gene on the Y chromosome. The clitoris is a complex structure, and its size and sensitivity can vary. The glans (head) of the human clitoris is roughly the size and shape of a pea, and is estimated to have more sensory nerve endings than any other part of the human body. Extensive sociological, sexological and medical debate have focused on the clitoris, primarily concerning anatomical accuracy, orgasmic factors and their physiological explanation for the G-Spot, and whether the clitoris is vestigial, an adaptation, or serves a reproductive function. Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy; genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons, and cultural perceptions also impact on knowledge of the clitoris. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison to that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men should be expected to master and control women's orgasms.

Social perceptions of the clitoris range from the significance of its role in female sexual pleasure, assumptions about its true size and depth, and varying beliefs regarding genital modification such as clitoris enlargement, clitoris piercing and clitoridectomy; genital modification may be for aesthetic, medical or cultural reasons, and cultural perceptions also impact on knowledge of the clitoris. Studies suggest that knowledge of its existence and anatomy is scant in comparison to that of other sexual organs, and that more education about it could help alleviate social stigmas associated with the female body and female sexual pleasure; for example, that the clitoris and vulva in general are visually unappealing, that female masturbation is taboo, or that men should be expected to master and control women's orgasms.

The tortrix moth genus Coccyx is nowadays considered a junior synonym of Cydia. The coccyx, commonly referred to as the tailbone, is the final segment of the vertebral column in tailless primates. Comprising three to five separate or fused vertebrae (the coccygeal vertebrae) below the sacrum, it is attached to the sacrum by a fibrocartilaginous joint, the sacrococcygeal symphysis, which permits limited movement between the sacrum and the coccyx. The term coccyx comes originally from the Greek ÎºÏŒÎºÎºÏ…Î¾ and means ""cuckoo"", referring to the curved shape of a cuckoo's beak when viewed from the side."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Duodenum	Duodenum	A03.556.124.684.124	"The duodenum /ËŒduËﾐÉ™ËˆdinÉ™m/ is the first section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear, and the terms anterior intestine or proximal intestine may be used instead of duodenum. In mammals the duodenum may be the principal site for iron absorption. The duodenum precedes the jejunum and ileum and is the shortest part of the small intestine, where most chemical digestion takes place. The name duodenum is from the Latin duodenum digitorum, or ""twelve fingers' breadth"". In humans, the duodenum is a hollow jointed tube about 25-38cm (10-15 inches) long connecting the stomach to the jejunum. It begins with the duodenal bulb and ends at the ligament of Treitz."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eardrum	Eardrum or Tympanic membrane Latin = membrana tympani	A09.246.272.702	The eardrum, or tympanic membrane, is a thin, cone-shaped membrane that separates the external ear from the middle ear in humans and other tetrapods. Its function is to transmit sound from the air to the ossicles inside the middle ear, and then to the oval window in the fluid-filled cochlea. Hence, it ultimately converts and amplifies vibration in air to vibration in fluid. The malleus bone bridges the gap between the eardrum and the other ossicles. There are two general regions of the tympanic membrane: the pars flaccida (upper region, see picture on right) and the pars tensa. The pars flaccida consists of two layers, is relatively fragile, and is associated with eustachian tube dysfunction and cholesteatomas. The larger pars tensa region consists of three layers: skin, fibrous tissue, and mucosa. It is comparatively robust, and is the region most commonly associated with perforations. Rupture or perforation of the eardrum can lead to conductive hearing loss. Collapse or retraction of the eardrum can also cause conductive hearing loss or even cholesteatoma.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ectoderm	Ectoderm	A16.254.425.273	"Ectoderm is one of the three primary germ cell layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the mesoderm (middle layer) and endoderm (most proximal layer), with the ectoderm as the most exterior (or distal) layer. It emerges first and forms from the outer layer of germ cells. The word ectoderm comes from the greek ektos meaning ""outside"", and derma, meaning ""skin. "" Generally speaking, the ectoderm differentiates to form the nervous system (spine, peripheral nerves and brain), tooth enamel and the epidermis (the outer part of integument). It also forms the lining of mouth, anus, nostrils, sweat glands, hair and nails. In vertebrates, the ectoderm has three parts: external ectoderm (also known as surface ectoderm), the neural crest, and neural tube. The latter two are known as neuroectoderm."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endoderm	Endoderm	A16.254.425.407	Endoderm is one of the three primary germ cell layers in the very early embryo. The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and mesoderm (middle layer), with the endoderm as the innermost layer. Cells migrating inward along the archenteron form the inner layer of the gastrula, which develops into the endoderm. The endoderm consists at first of flattened cells, which subsequently become columnar. It forms the epithelial lining of multiple systems.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ethmoid_bone	Ethmoid bone	A02.835.232.781.292	The ethmoid bone is a bone in the skull that separates the nasal cavity from the brain. It is located at the roof of the nose, between the two orbits. The cubical bone is lightweight due to a spongy construction. The ethmoid bone is one of the bones that makes up the orbit of the eye. The ethmoid has three parts: the cribriform plate, the ethmoidal labyrinth, and the perpendicular plate.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fallopian_tube	Fallopian Tubes	A05.360.319.114.373	The Fallopian tubes, also known as oviducts, uterine tubes, and salpinges (singular salpinx) are two very fine tubes lined with ciliated epithelia, leading from the ovaries of female mammals into the uterus, via the utero-tubal junction. In non-mammalian vertebrates, the equivalent structures are the oviducts.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femur	Femur	A02.835.232.500.247	The femur (pl. femurs or femora), or thigh bone, is the most proximal (closest to the center of the body) bone of the leg in tetrapod vertebrates capable of walking or jumping, such as most land mammals, birds, many reptiles such as lizards, and amphibians such as frogs. In vertebrates with four legs such as dogs and horses, the femur is found only in the rear legs. The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum in the pelvic bone forming the hip joint, while the distal part of the femur articulates with the tibia and patella forming the knee joint. By most measures the femur is the strongest bone in the body.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Fibula	Fibula	A02.835.232.043.650.321	The fibula or calf bone is a leg bone located on the lateral side of the tibia, with which it is connected above and below. It is the smaller of the two bones, and, in proportion to its length, the slenderest of all the long bones. Its upper extremity is small, placed toward the back of the head of the tibia, below the level of the knee joint, and excluded from the formation of this joint. Its lower extremity inclines a little forward, so as to be on a plane anterior to that of the upper end; it projects below the tibia, and forms the lateral part of the ankle joint.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Foot	Foot	A01.378.610.250	The foot (plural feet) is an anatomical structure found in many vertebrates. It is the terminal portion of a limb which bears weight and allows locomotion. In many animals with feet, the foot is a separate organ at the terminal part of the leg made up of one or more segments or bones, generally including claws or nails.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Forearm	Forearm	A01.378.800.585	"The forearm is the structure and distal region of the upper limb, between the elbow and the wrist. The term forearm is used in anatomy to distinguish it from the arm, a word which is most often used to describe the entire appendage of the upper limb, but in anatomy, technically, it means only the region of the upper arm, whereas the lower ""arm"" is called the forearm. It is homologous to the leg that lies between the knee and the ankle joints. The forearm contains two long bones, the radius and the ulna, forming the radioulnar joint. The interosseous membrane connects these bones. Ultimately, the forearm is covered by skin, the anterior surface usually being less hairy than the posterior surface. The forearm contains many muscles, including the flexors and extensors of the digits, a flexor of the elbow, and pronators and supinators that turn the hand to face down or upwards, respectively. In cross-section the forearm can be divided into two fascial compartments. The posterior compartment contains the extensors of the hands, which are supplied by the radial nerve. The anterior compartment contains the flexors, and is mainly supplied by the median nerve. The ulnar nerve also runs the length of the forearm. The radial and ulnar arteries, and their branches, supply the blood to the forearm. These usually run on the anterior face of the radius and ulna down the whole forearm. The main superficial veins of the forearm are the cephalic, median antebrachial and the basilic vein. These veins can be used for cannularisation or venipuncture, although the cubital fossa is a preferred site for getting blood."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Forehead	Forehead	A01.456.505.580	In human anatomy, the forehead is the fore part of the head. It is, formally, an area of the head bounded by three features, two of the skull and one of the scalp. The top of the forehead is marked by the hairline, the edge of the area where hair on the scalp grows. The bottom of the forehead is marked by the supraorbital ridge, the bone feature of the skull above the eyes. The two sides of the forehead are marked by the temporal ridge, a bone feature that links the supraorbital ridge to the coronal suture line and beyond.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontal_bone	Frontal bone	A02.835.232.781.375	The frontal bone or os frontis is a bone in the human skull. The name comes from the Latin word frons. The bone resembles a cockleshell in form, and consists of three portions: a large vertical portion, the squama frontalis, corresponding with the region of the forehead. an orbital or horizontal portion, the pars orbitalis, which enters into the formation of the roofs of the orbital and nasal cavities. a nasal portion, it articulates with the nasal bones and the frontal process of the maxilla to form the root of the nose.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hand	Hand	A01.378.800.667	"A hand is a prehensile, multi-fingered extremity located at the end of an arm or forelimb of primates and humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. A few other vertebrates such as the koala (which has two opposable thumbs on each ""hand"" and fingerprints remarkably similar to human fingerprints) are often described as having either ""hands"" or ""paws"" on their front limbs. Hands are the main structures for physically manipulating the environment, used for both gross motor skills (such as grasping a large object) and fine motor skills (such as picking up a small pebble). The fingertips contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body, are the richest source of tactile feedback, and have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands. Like other paired organs (eyes, feet, legs), each hand is dominantly controlled by the opposing brain hemisphere, so that handedness, or the preferred hand choice for single-handed activities such as writing with a pencil, reflects individual brain functioning. Some evolutionary anatomists use the term hand to refer to the appendage of digits on the forelimb more generallyÂ â€” for example, in the context of whether the three digits of the bird hand involved the same homologous loss of two digits as in the dinosaur hand. The human hand has 27 bones, not including the sesamoid bones which number varies between people. 14 of which are the phalanges of the fingers. The metacarpals are the bones that connects the fingers and the wrist. Each human hand has 5 metacarpals and 8 carpal bones."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_pharynx	Pharynx	A03.556.750	The human pharynx is the part of the throat situated immediately inferior to (below) the mouth and nasal cavity, and superior to the esophagus and larynx. The human pharynx is conventionally divided into three sections: the nasopharynx (epipharynx), the oropharynx (mesopharynx), and the laryngopharynx (hypopharynx). The pharynx is part of the digestive system and also the respiratory system; it is also important in vocalization.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Humerus	Humerus	A02.835.232.087.090.400	The humerus is a long bone in the arm or forelimb that runs from the shoulder to the elbow. Anatomically, in modern humans, it connects the scapula and the lower arm, and consists of three sections. The upper extremity consists of a rounded head, a narrow neck, and two short processes (tubercles, sometimes called tuberosities. ) Its body is cylindrical in its upper portion, and more prismatic below. The lower extremity consists of 2 epicondyles, 2 processes, and 3 fossae. As well as its true anatomical neck, the constriction below the greater and lesser tubercles of the humerus is referred to as its surgical neck due to its tendency to commonly get fractured, thus often becoming the focus of surgeons.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hymen	Hymen	A05.360.319.779.479	The hymen is a membrane that surrounds or partially covers the external vaginal opening. It forms part of the vulva, or external genitalia, and is similar in structure to the vagina. In children, although a common appearance of the hymen is crescent-shaped, many shapes are possible. The effects of sexual intercourse and childbirth on the hymen are variable. If the hymen is sufficiently elastic, it may return to nearly its original condition. In other cases, there may be remnants, or it may appear completely absent after repeated penetration. Additionally, the hymen may be lacerated by disease, injury, medical examination, masturbation or even physical exercise. For these reasons, it is not possible to definitively determine whether or not a girl or woman is a virgin by examining her hymen.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ilium_(bone)	Ilium of pelvis	A02.835.232.611.434	"The ilium is the uppermost and largest bone of the pelvis, and appears in most vertebrates including mammals and birds, but not bony fish. All reptiles have an ilium except snakes, although some snake species have a tiny bone which is considered to be an ilium. The name comes from the Latin, meaning ""groin"" or ""flank. "" The ilium of the human is divisible into two parts, the body and the ala; the separation is indicated on the top surface by a curved line, the arcuate line, and on the external surface by the margin of the acetabulum."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ischium	Ischium of pelvis	A02.835.232.611.548	"The ischium forms the lower and back part of the hip bone (os coxae). The word ischium dates back to c. 164o B.C.E. , from Greek á¼°ÏƒÏ‡Î¯Î¿Î½ iskhion meaning ""hip joint"", in plural, ""the hips"", and most likely comes from Î¹ÏƒÏ‡ÏﾍÏ‚ iskhys ""loin"", which is of unknown origin. Situated below the ilium and behind the pubis, it is one of these three bones whose fusion creates the coxa. The superior portion of this bone forms approximately one third of the acetabulum. It is divisible into three portions: Body of ischium - Contains a prominent spine which serves as the origin for gemellus superior. The indentation inferior to the spine is the lesser sciatic notch. Continuing down the posterior side, the ischial tuberosity is a thick, rough surfaced prominence below the lesser sciatic notch. This is the portion that supports weight while sitting (especially noticeable on a hard surface). It can be felt simply by sitting on oneâ€™s fingers. Additionally, it serves as the origin for gemellus inferior and adductor magnus. Superior ramus of the ischium - Serves as a partial origin for obturator internus and obturator externus. Inferior ramus of the ischium - Serves as a partial origin for gracillis and adductor magnus. The ischial ramus joins the inferior ramus of the pubis anteriorly. It is the strongest of the coxal bones. Clinically, avulsion fracture of the ischial apophysis may occur (Wootton 1990). Avulsion fractures of the hip bone (avulsion or tearing away of the ischial tuberosity) may occur in adolescents and young adults during sports that require sudden acceleration or deceleration forces, such as sprinting or kicking in football, soccer, jumping hurdles, basketball, and martial arts. These fractures occur at apophyses (bony projections that lack secondary ossification centers). Avulsion fractures occur where muscles are attached: anterior superior and inferior iliac spines, ischial tuberosities, and ischiopubic rami. A small part of bone with a piece of a tendon or ligament attached is avulsed (torn away) (Moore 2006)."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Liver	Liver	A03.620	The liver is a vital organ present in vertebrates and some other animals. It has a wide range of functions, including detoxification, protein synthesis, and production of biochemicals necessary for digestion. The liver is necessary for survival; there is currently no way to compensate for the absence of liver function in the long term, although new liver dialysis techniques can be used in the short term. This organ plays a major role in metabolism and has a number of functions in the body, including glycogen storage, decomposition of red blood cells, plasma protein synthesis, hormone production, and detoxification. It lies below the diaphragm in the abdominal-pelvic region of the abdomen. It produces bile, an alkaline compound which aids in digestion via the emulsification of lipids. The liver's highly specialized tissues regulate a wide variety of high-volume biochemical reactions, including the synthesis and breakdown of small and complex molecules, many of which are necessary for normal vital functions. Terminology related to the liver often starts in hepar- or hepat- from the Greek word for liver, hÄ“par (á¼§Ï€Î±Ïﾁ, root hepat-, á¼¡Ï€Î±Ï„-).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medulla_oblongata	Medulla oblongata	A08.186.211.132.810.406	The medulla oblongata is the lower half of the brainstem. In discussions of neurology and similar contexts where no ambiguity will result, it is often referred to as simply the medulla. The medulla contains the cardiac, respiratory, vomiting and vasomotor centers and deals with autonomic, involuntary functions, such as breathing, heart rate and blood pressure. The bulb is an archaic term for the medulla oblongata; in modern clinical usage, it sometimes includes the pons as well. The word bulbar therefore refers to the nerves and tracts connected to the medulla, and also by association to the muscles thus innervated, those of the tongue, pharynx and larynx.

The other two layers are the ectoderm (outside layer) and endoderm (inside layer), with the mesoderm as the middle layer between them. The mesoderm forms mesenchyme (connective tissue), mesothelium, non-epithelial blood cells and coelomocytes. Mesothelium lines coeloms; forms the muscles, septa (cross-wise partitions) and mesenteries (length-wise partitions); and forms part of the gonads (the rest being the gametes). The mesoderm differentiates from the rest of the embryo through intercellular signaling, after which the mesoderm is polarized by an organizing center.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Palate	Palate	A14.521.658	"The palate is the roof of the mouth in humans and other mammals. It separates the oral cavity from the nasal cavity. A similar structure is found in crocodilians, but, in most other tetrapods, the oral and nasal cavities are not truly separate. The palate is divided into two parts, the anterior bony hard palate, and the posterior fleshy soft palate or velum. The maxillary nerve branch of the trigeminal nerve (V) supplies sensory innervation to the palate. The hard palate forms before birth. If the fusion is incomplete, it is called a cleft palate. As the roof of the mouth was once considered the seat of the sense of taste, palate can also refer to this sense itself, as in the phrase ""a discriminating palate"". By further extension, the flavor of a food (particularly beer or wine) may be called its palate, as when a wine is said to have an oaky palate."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pleural_cavity	Pleural cavity	A01.911.800.650	In human anatomy, the pleural cavity is the potential space between the two pleura (visceral and parietal) of the lungs. The pleura is a serous membrane which folds back onto itself to form a two-layered membrane structure. The thin space between the two pleural layers is known as the pleural cavity and normally contains a small amount of pleural fluid. The outer pleura is attached to the chest wall. The inner pleura covers the lungs and adjoining structures, via. blood vessels, bronchi and nerves. The parietal pleura is highly sensitive to pain, while the visceral pleura is not, due to its lack of sensory innervation.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pubis_(bone)	Pubic of pelvis	A02.835.232.611.781	For the bone in many mammals often called the penis bone, see baculum In vertebrates, the pubic bone is the ventral and anterior of the three principal bones composing either half of the pelvis. It is covered by a layer of fat, which is covered by the mons pubis. It is divisible into a body, a superior ramus and an inferior ramus. The body forms one-fifth of the acetabulum, contributing by its external surface both to the lunate surface and the acetabular fossa. Its internal surface enters into the formation of the wall of the lesser pelvis and gives origin to a portion of the obturator internus. In the female, the pubic bone is anterior to the urethral sponge. The left and right hip bones join at the pubic symphysis. The pubis is the lower limit of the suprapubic region.

It is one of the only arteries (other than the umbilical arteries in the fetus) that carry deoxygenated blood. In the human heart, the pulmonary trunk (pulmonary artery or main pulmonary artery) begins at the base of the right ventricle. It is short and wideâ€”approximately 5 centimetres in length and 3 centimetres in diameter. It then branches into two pulmonary arteries (left and right), which deliver de-oxygenated blood to the corresponding lung. In contrast to the pulmonary arteries, the bronchial arteries supply nutrition to the lungs themselves.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Retina	Retina	A09.371.729	Retina can also refer to the Kodak Retina camera and the Apple Retina Display. The vertebrate retina is a light-sensitive layer of tissue, lining the inner surface of the eye. The optics of the eye create an image of the visual world on the retina, which serves much the same function as the film in a camera. Light striking the retina initiates a cascade of chemical and electrical events that ultimately trigger nerve impulses. These are sent to various visual centres of the brain through the fibres of the optic nerve. In vertebrate embryonic development, the retina and the optic nerve originate as outgrowths of the developing brain, so the retina is considered part of the central nervous system (CNS) and is actually brain tissue. It is the only part of the CNS that can be visualized non-invasively. The retina is a layered structure with several layers of neurons interconnected by synapses. The only neurons that are directly sensitive to light are the photoreceptor cells. These are mainly of two types: the rods and cones. Rods function mainly in dim light and provide black-and-white vision, while cones support daytime vision and the perception of colour. A third, much rarer type of photoreceptor, the photosensitive ganglion cell, is important for reflexive responses to bright daylight. Neural signals from the rods and cones undergo processing by other neurons of the retina. The output takes the form of action potentials in retinal ganglion cells whose axons form the optic nerve. Several important features of visual perception can be traced to the retinal encoding and processing of light.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sacrum	Sacrum	A02.835.232.834.717	In humans, the sacrum is a large, triangular bone at the base of the spine and at the upper and back part of the pelvic cavity, where it is inserted like a wedge between the two hip bones. Its upper part connects with the last lumbar vertebra, and bottom part with the coccyx (tailbone). It consists of usually five initially unfused vertebrae which begin to fuse between ages 16â€“18 and are usually completely fused into a single bone by age 34. It is curved upon itself and placed obliquely (that is, tilted forward). It is kyphoticâ€”that is, concave facing forward. The base projects forward as the sacral promontory internally, and articulates with the last lumbar vertebra to form the prominent sacrovertebral angle. The central part is curved outward toward the posterior, allowing greater room for the pelvic cavity. The two lateral projections of the sacrum are called ala (wings), and articulate with the ilium at the L-shaped sacroiliac joints.

In other organisms such as insects, salivary glands are often used to produce biologically important proteins like silk or glues, and fly salivary glands contain polytene chromosomes that have been useful in genetic research.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scapula	shoulder blade	A02.835.232.087.783	"In anatomy, the scapula (plural scapulae) (Medical Latin), or shoulder blade, is the bone that connects the humerus (upper arm bone) with the clavicle (collar bone). Medically known as the scapula, it is thought that the word ""scapula"" came from the Greek word skaptein, which means â€œto dig. "" In early Roman times, people thought the bone resembled a trowel, a small shovel. The shoulder blade is also called omo in Latin medical terminology. The scapula forms the posterior (back) located part of the shoulder girdle. In humans, it is a flat bone, roughly triangular in shape, placed on a posterolateral aspect of the thoracic cage."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sclera	Sclera	A09.371.784	The sclera (from the Greek skleros, meaning hard), also known as the white of the eye, is the opaque, fibrous, protective, outer layer of the eye containing collagen and elastic fiber. In humans the whole sclera is white, contrasting with the coloured iris, but in other mammals the visible part of the sclera matches the colour of the iris, so the white part does not normally show. In the development of the embryo, the sclera is derived from the neural crest. In children, it is thinner and shows some of the underlying pigment, appearing slightly blue. In the elderly, fatty deposits on the sclera can make it appear slightly yellow. Human eyes are somewhat distinctive in the animal kingdom in that the sclera is very plainly visible whenever the eye is open. This is not just due to the white color of the human sclera, which many other species share, but also to the fact that the human iris is relatively small and comprises a significantly smaller portion of the exposed eye surface compared to other animals. It is theorized that this adaptation evolved because of our social nature as the eye became a useful communication tool in addition to a sensory organ. It is believed that the conspicuous sclera of the human eye makes it easier for one individual to infer where another individual is looking, increasing the efficacy of this particular form of nonverbal communication. Animal researchers have also found that, in the course of their domestication, dogs have also developed the ability to pick up visual cues from the eyes of humans, making them one of only two species known to seek visual cues from another individual's eyes. Dogs do not seem to use this form of communication with one another and only look for visual information from the eyes of humans.

Scrotum File:HQ SAM ST. jpg Human scrotum (both relaxed and tense states) Latin Scrotum Gray's subject #258 1237 Artery Anterior scrotal artery & Posterior scrotal artery Vein Testicular vein Nerve Posterior scrotal nerves, Anterior scrotal nerves, genital branch of genitofemoral nerve, perineal branches of posterior femoral cutaneous nerve Lymph Superficial inguinal lymph nodes Precursor labioscrotal folds MeSH Scrotum In some male mammals, the scrotum is a dual-chambered protuberance of skin and muscle, containing the testicles and divided by a septum. It is an extension of the perineum, and is located between the penis and anus. In humans and some other mammals, the scrotum becomes covered with pubic hairs at puberty. The scrotum is homologous to the labia majora in females."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spermatozoon	Spermat	A05.360.490.890	A spermatozoon is a motile sperm cell, or moving form of the haploid cell that is the male gamete. A spermatozoon joins an ovum to form a zygote. (A zygote is a single cell, with a complete set of chromosomes, that normally develops into an embryo. ) Sperm cells contribute approximately half of the nuclear genetic information to the diploid offspring (excluding, in most cases, mitochondrial DNA). In mammals, the sex of the offspring is determined by the sperm cell: a spermatozoon bearing a Y chromosome will lead to a male (XY) offspring, while one bearing an X chromosome will lead to a female (XX) offspringâ€”the X chromosome. Sperm cells were first observed by Anton van Leeuwenhoek in 1677.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sphenoid_bone	Sphenoid bone	A02.835.232.781.802	The sphenoid bone is an unpaired bone situated at the front middle of the skull in front of the temporal bone and basilar part of the occipital bone. The sphenoid bone is one of the seven bones that articulate to form the orbit. Its shape somewhat resembles that of a butterfly or bat with its wings extended.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stomach	Stomach	A03.556.875.875	"The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the digestion system which functions as an important organ of the digestive tract in some animals, including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. It is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing). The stomach is located between the esophagus and the small intestine. It secretes protein-digesting enzymes called protease and strong acids to aid in food digestion, through smooth muscular contortions (called segmentation) before sending partially digested food to the small intestines. The word stomach is derived from the Latin stomachus which is derived from the Greek word stomachos (ÏƒÏ„ÏŒÎ¼Î±Ï‡Î¿Ï‚), ultimately from stoma (ÏƒÏ„ÏŒÎ¼Î±), ""mouth"". The words gastro- and gastric (meaning related to the stomach) are both derived from the Greek word gaster (Î³Î±ÏƒÏ„Î®Ïﾁ)."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thoracic_diaphragm	Diaphragm	A02.633.567.900.300	"In the anatomy of mammals, the thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm, is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle that extends across the bottom of the rib cage. The diaphragm separates the thoracic cavity (heart, lungs & ribs) from the abdominal cavity and performs an important function in respiration: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases and air is drawn into the lungs. A ""diaphragm"" in anatomy can refer to other flat structures such as the urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm, but ""the diaphragm"" generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm. Other vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles have diaphragm-like structures, but important details of the anatomy vary, such as the position of lungs in the abdominal cavity."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tibia	Tibia	A02.835.232.043.650.883	The tibia, shinbone or shankbone, is the larger and stronger of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula), and connects the knee with the ankle bones. The tibia is found next to the fibula on the medial side of the leg. The tibia is connected to the fibula by an interosseous membrane, forming a type of joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the Greek aulos flute, also known as a tibia. It is commonly recognized as the strongest weightbearing bone of the body.

It is the largest of the cranial nerves. Its name (""trigeminal"" = tri- or three, and -geminus or twin, or thrice twinned) derives from the fact that each trigeminal nerve, one on each side of the pons, has three major branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2), and the mandibular nerve (V3). The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory. The mandibular nerve has both sensory and motor functions. Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system. The motor division of the trigeminal nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, while the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ulna	Ulna	A02.835.232.087.090.850	The ulna or elbow bone is one of the two long bones in the forearm, the other being the radius. It is prismatic in form and runs parallel to the radius, which is shorter and smaller. In anatomical position (i.e. when the arms are down at the sides of the body and the palms of the hands face forward) the ulna is located at the side of the forearm closest to the body, the side of the little finger.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ureter	Ureter	A05.810.776	"In human anatomy, the ureters are tubes made of smooth muscle fibers that propel urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. In the adult, the ureters are usually 25â€“30Â cm (&#160) long and ~3-4 mm in diameter. Histologically, the ureter contains transitional epithelium and an additional smooth muscle layer in the more distal one-third to assist with peristalsis. In humans, the ureters arise from the renal pelvis on the medial aspect of each kidney before descending towards the bladder on the front of the psoas major muscle. The ureters cross the pelvic brim near the bifurcation of the iliac arteries (which they cross anteriorly). This is a common site for the impaction of kidney stones (the others being the ureterovesical valve, where the ureter meets the bladder, and the pelvouteric junction, where the renal pelvis meets the ureter in the renal hilum). The ureters run posteroinferiorly on the lateral walls of the pelvis and then curve anteriormedially to enter the bladder through the back, at the vesicoureteric junction, running within the wall of the bladder for a few centimetres. The backflow of urine is prevented by valves known as ureterovesical valves. In females, the ureters pass through the mesometrium and under the uterine arteries on the way to the urinary bladder. An effective phrase for remembering this anatomical relationship is ""water (ureters) under the bridge (uterine arteries or vas deferens). "" Ureters are also found in all other amniote species, although different ducts fulfill the same role in amphibians and fish.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urethra	Urethra	A05.360.444.492.726	In anatomy, the urethra (from Greek Î¿á½ﾐÏﾁÎ®Î¸ÏﾁÎ± - ourethra) is a tube that connects the urinary bladder to the genitals for the removal of fluids from the body. In males, the urethra travels through the penis, and carries semen as well as urine. In female placental mammals, the urethra is shorter and emerges above the vaginal opening. Female placental mammals use their urethra only for urinating, but male placental mammals use their urethra for both urination and ejaculation. The external urethral sphincter is a striated muscle that allows voluntary control over urination.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Uterus	Uterus	A05.360.319.679	"The uterus (from Latin ""uterus"", plural uteri) or womb is a major female hormone-responsive reproductive sex organ of most mammals including humans. One end, the cervix, opens into the vagina, while the other is connected to one or both fallopian tubes, depending on the species. It is within the uterus that the fetus develops during gestation, usually developing completely in placental mammals such as humans and partially in marsupials such as kangaroos and opossums. Two uteri usually form initially in a female fetus, and in placental mammals they may partially or completely fuse into a single uterus depending on the species. In many species with two uteri, only one is functional. Humans and other higher primates such as chimpanzees, along with horses, usually have a single completely fused uterus, although in some individuals the uteri may not have completely fused. In English, the term uterus is used consistently within the medical and related professions, while the Germanic-derived term womb is more common in everyday usage. Most animals that lay eggs, such as birds and reptiles, including most ovoviviparous species, have an oviduct instead of a uterus. Note however, that recent research into the biology of the viviparous skink Trachylepis ivensi has revealed development of a very close analogue to eutherian mammalian placental development. In monotremes, mammals which lay eggs, namely the platypus and the echidnas, either the term uterus or oviduct is used to describe the same organ, but the egg does not develop a placenta within the mother and thus does not receive further nourishment after formation and fertilization. Marsupials have two uteri, each of which connect to a lateral vagina and which both use a third, middle ""vagina"" which functions as the birth canal. Marsupial embryos form a choriovitelline ""placenta"" (which can be thought of as something between a monotreme egg and a ""true"" placenta), in which the egg's yolk sac supplies a large part of the embryo's nutrition but also attaches to the uterine wall and takes nutrients from the mother's bloodstream."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagina	Vagina	A05.360.319.779	"The vagina is a fibromuscular tubular tract which is a sex organ and has two main functions; sexual intercourse and childbirth. In humans, this passage leads from the opening of the vulva to the uterus (womb), but the vaginal tract ends at the cervix. Unlike men, who have only one genital orifice, women have two, the urethra and the vagina. The vaginal opening is much larger than the urethral opening, and both openings are protected by the labia. The inner mould of the vagina has a foldy texture which can create friction for the penis during intercourse. During arousal, the vagina gets moist to facilitate the entrance of the penis. The Latinate plural ""vaginae"" is rarely used in English. Colloquially, the word vagina is often used to refer to the vulva or to the female genitals in general. However, by its dictionary and anatomical definitions, vagina refers exclusively to the specific internal structure."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vagus_nerve	Vagus nerve	A08.800.800.122.901	"The vagus nerve, also called pneumogastric nerve or cranial nerve X, is the tenth of twelve paired cranial nerves. Upon leaving the medulla between the medullary pyramid and the inferior cerebellar peduncle, it extends through the jugular foramen, then passes into the carotid sheath between the internal carotid artery and the internal jugular vein down below the head, to the neck, chest and abdomen, where it contributes to the innervation of the viscera. Besides output to the various organs in the body, the vagus nerve conveys sensory information about the state of the body's organs to the central nervous system. 80-90% of the nerve fibers in the vagus nerve are afferent (sensory) nerves communicating the state of the viscera to the brain. The medieval Latin word vagus means literally ""wandering"". Sometimes the branches are spoken of in the plural and are thus called vagi. The vagus is also called the pneumogastric nerve since it innervates both the lungs and the stomach. The motor division of the vagus nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata, while the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest. The vagus nerve includes axons which emerge from or converge onto four nuclei of the medulla: The Dorsal nucleus of vagus nerve - which sends parasympathetic output to the viscera, especially the intestines The Nucleus ambiguus - which gives rise to the branchial efferent motor fibers of the vagus nerve and preganglionic parasympathetic neurons that innervate the heart The Solitary nucleus - which receives afferent taste information and primary afferents from visceral organs The Spinal trigeminal nucleus - which receives information about deep/crude touch, pain, and temperature of the outer ear, the dura of the posterior cranial fossa and the mucosa of the larynx"

The cecum is a pouchlike structure of the colon. The appendix is located near the junction of the small intestine and the large intestine. The term ""vermiform"" comes from Latin and means ""worm-shaped"". It is widely present in the Euarchontoglires and has also evolved independently in the diprotodont marsupials, monotremes, and is highly diverse in size and shape."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vertebrate_trachea	Vertebrate trachea	A04.889	In tetrapod anatomy the trachea, or windpipe, is a tube that connects the pharynx and larynx to the lungs, allowing the passage of air. It is lined with pseudostratified ciliated columnar epithelium cells with goblet cells that produce mucus. This mucus lines the cells of the trachea to trap inhaled foreign particles that the cilia then waft upward toward the larynx and then the pharynx where it can be either swallowed into the stomach or expelled as phlegm. Despite the name, not all vertebrates have a trachea; only non-fish ones. The name is used in contrast with invertebrate trachea, a structure in arthropod anatomy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vulva	Human vulva	5.36	"The vulva (from the Latin vulva, plural vulvae, see etymology) consists of the external genital organs of the female mammal. This article deals with the vulva of the human being, although the structures are similar for other mammals. The vulva has many major and minor anatomical structures, including the labia majora, mons pubis, labia minora, clitoris, bulb of vestibule, vulval vestibule, greater and lesser vestibular glands, and the opening of the vagina. Its development occurs during several phases, chiefly during the fetal and pubertal periods of time. As the outer portal of the human uterus or womb, it protects its opening by a ""double door"": the labia majora (large lips) and the labia minora (small lips). The vagina is a self-cleaning organ, sustaining healthy microbial flora that flow from the inside out; the vulva needs only simple washing to assure good vulvovaginal health, without recourse to any internal cleansing. The vulva has a sexual function; these external organs are richly innervated and provide pleasure when properly stimulated. In various branches of art, the vulva has been depicted as the organ that has the power both to ""give life"" (often associated with the womb), and to give sexual pleasure to humankind. The vulva also contains the opening of the female urethra, but apart from this has little relevance to the function of urination."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Confluence_of_sinuses	Confluence of sinuses	A07.231.908.224	"The confluence of sinuses or torcular herophili is the connecting point of the superior sagittal sinus, straight sinus, and occipital sinus. It is found deep to the occipital protuberance of the skull. Blood arriving at this point then proceeds to drain into the left and right transverse sinuses. The superior sagittal sinus often drains into (either exclusively or predominantly) one transverse sinus, and the straight sinus drains into the other. An older term often used for the confluence of sinuses ""torcular herophili"", describes the veins as a gutter, or canal, and honors Herophilos, the Greek anatomist who was the first to use cadavers for the systematic study of anatomy. This term more precisely refers to the concavity in the bone which is the location of the confluence of sinuses."

They produce a clear, odorless substance, consisting primarily of water and NaCl (note that the odor from sweat is due to bacterial activity on the secretions of the apocrine glands). NaCl is reabsorbed in the duct to reduce salt loss. They are active in thermoregulation and emotional sweating (induced by anxiety, fear, stress, and pain). Eccrine glands are composed of an intreaepidermal spiral duct, the ""acrosyringium""; a dermal duct, comprising a straight and coiled portion; and a secretory tubule, coiled deep in the dermis or hypodermis. Eccrine glands are innervated by the sympathetic nervous system, primarily by cholinergic fibers, but by adrenergic fibers as well. Dermcidin is a newly isolated antimicrobial peptide produced by the eccrine sweat glands."

Human skin is similar to that of most other mammals, except that it is not protected by a pelt. Though nearly all human skin is covered with hair follicles, it can appear hairless. There are two general types of skin, hairy and glabrous skin. The adjective cutaneous literally means ""of the skin"" (from Latin cutis, skin). Because it interfaces with the environment, skin plays a key role in protecting the body against pathogens and excessive water loss. Its other functions are insulation, temperature regulation, sensation, synthesis of vitamin D, and the protection of vitamin B folates. Severely damaged skin will try to heal by forming scar tissue. This is often discolored and depigmented. In humans, skin pigmentation varies among populations, and skin type can range from dry to oily. Such skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for bacteria which number roughly at 1000 species from 19 phyla."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Abdominal_cavity	Abdominal cavity	A01.047.025	The abdominal cavity is the body cavity of the human body (and animal bodies) that holds the bulk of the viscera. It is located below the thoracic cavity, and above the pelvic cavity. Its dome-shaped roof is the thoracic diaphragm (a thin sheet of muscle under the lungs), and its oblique floor is the pelvic inlet (the superior opening of the pelvis). It is a part of the abdominopelvic cavity. It is well connected with the pleural (thoracic) cavity. Organs of the abdominal cavity include the stomach, liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, small intestine, kidneys, and large intestine. The abdominal cavity is lined with a protective membrane termed the peritoneum. The kidneys are located in the abdominal cavity behind the peritoneum, in the retroperitoneum.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aortic_arch	Arch of aorta, aortic arch	A07.231.114.056.372.	The arch of the aorta or the transverse aortic arch is the part of the aorta that begins at the level of the upper border of the second sternocostal articulation of the right side, and runs at first upward, backward, and to the left in front of the trachea; it is then directed backward on the left side of the trachea and finally passes downward on the left side of the body of the fourth thoracic vertebra, at the lower border of which it becomes continuous with the descending aorta. It thus forms two curvatures: one with its convexity upward, the other with its convexity forward and to the left. Its upper border is usually about 2.5Â cm. below the superior border to the manubrium sterni. Coming out of the heart, the thoracic aorta has a maximum dimension of 4 cm at the root. By the time it becomes the ascending aorta, the diameter should be < 35-38 mm, and 30 mm at the arch. The descending aortaâ€™s diameter shouldnâ€™t exceed 25 mm. The arch of the Aorta lies within the mediastinum.

It arises from cells in the nucleus ala cinerea, the parasympathetic nucleus of origin for the tenth cranial nerve, located in the medulla oblongata. The fibers are carried by both the anterior and posterior vagal nerves. The myenteric plexus is the major nerve supply to the gastrointestinal tract and controls GI tract motility.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bowman's_membrane	Bowman's membrane	A09.371.060.217.113	The Bowman's membrane (Bowman's layer, anterior limiting lamina, anterior elastic lamina) is a smooth layer in the eye. It is located between the superficial epithelium and the stroma in the cornea. It is composed of strong collagen fibers and helps the cornea maintain its shape. If the Bowman's membrane is damaged, scarring will normally occur. In adult humans this layer is 8-12 Î¼m thick. Bowman's layer, which (in mammals) is found only in primates, is absent in cats, dogs, mice, and other carnivores. The Bowman's membrane is named after Sir William Bowman (1816â€“1892), an English physician, anatomist and ophthalmologist, who discovered this membrane. Part of the tissue ablated by the Photorefractive keratectomy refractive surgery (commonly known as PRK) is the Bowman membrane; the section of the membrane ablated in the procedure is lost forever.

The nerves that comprise the cauda equina innervate the pelvic organs and lower limbs to include motor innervation of the hips, knees, ankles, feet, internal anal sphincter and external anal sphincter. In addition, the cauda equina extends to sensory innervation of the perineum and, partially, parasympathetic innervation of the bladder. The cauda equina was named after its resemblance to a horse's tail by the French anatomist Andreas Lazarius in the 17th century."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endoneurium	Endoneurium	A08.800.800	The endoneurium, also referred to as an endoneurial channel, sheath or tube, is a layer of delicate connective tissue made up of endoneurial cells that encloses the myelin sheath of a spinal cord nerve fiber. These are bundled up into groups called nerve fascicles, which have a protective sheath called a perineurium. Several fascicles may be in turn bundled together with a blood supply and fatty tissue within yet another sheath, the epineurium. The endoneurium contains a low protein liquid known as endoneurial fluid that is the peripheral nervous system equivalent to cerebro-spinal fluid in the central nervous system. Peripheral nerve injuries can be identified by checking for increased amounts of endoneurial fluid using magnetic resonance neurography. It is continuous with septa which pass inward from the innermost layer of the perineurium, and shows a ground substance in which are imbedded fine bundles of fibrous connective tissue, primarily collagen, running for the most part longitudinally. It serves to support capillary blood vessels, arranged so as to form a network with elongated meshes. It is found in other places too, such as surrounding the Schwann cells on the peripheral side of the transitional zone on the auditory nerve.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inferior_colliculus	Inferior colliculus	A08.186.211.132.659.237.364	The inferior colliculus (IC) is the principal midbrain nucleus of the auditory pathway and receives input from several more peripheral brainstem nuclei in the auditory pathway, as well as inputs from the auditory cortex. The inferior colliculus has three subdivisions: the central nucleus (CIC), a dorsal cortex (DCIC) by which it is surrounded, and an external cortex (ICX) which is located laterally. Its bimodal neurons are implied in auditory-somatosensory interaction, receiving projections from somatosensory nuclei. This multisensory integration may underlie a filtering of self-effected sounds from vocalisation, chewing, or respiration activities. The inferior colliculi together with the superior colliculi form the eminences of the corpora quadrigemina, and also part of the tectal region of the midbrain. The inferior colliculus lies caudal to its counterpart - the superior colliculus - above the trochlear nerve, and at the base of the projection of the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN).

It is on the ulnar side of the hand, but does not articulate with the ulna. It connects with the pisiform, hamate, and lunate bones. It is the 3rd most commonly fractured carpal bone. The triangular bone may be distinguished by its pyramidal shape, and by an oval isolated facet for articulation with the pisiform bone. It is situated at the upper and ulnar side of the carpus. To facilitate its palpation in an exam, the hand must be radially deviated so that the triquetrium moves out from under the ulnar styloid process.

This nerve is directly connected to the little finger, and the adjacent half of the ring finger, supplying the palmar side of these fingers, including both front and back of the tips, perhaps as far back as the fingernail beds. One method of injuring the nerve is to strike the medial epicondyle of the humerus from posteriorly, or inferiorly with the elbow flexed. The ulnar nerve is trapped between the bone and the overlying skin at this point. This is commonly referred to as bumping one's ""funny bone"". This name is thought to be a pun, based on the sound resemblance between the name of the bone of the upper arm, the ""humerus"" and the word ""humorous"". Alternatively, according to the Oxford English Dictionary it may refer to ""the peculiar sensation experienced when it is struck""."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Astragalectomy	Talus bone	A02.835.232.043.300.710.780	Astragalectomy, sometimes called a talectomy is a surgical operation for removal of the talus bone (astragalus) for stabilization of the ankle. Historically, an astragalectomy was used in cases of severe ankle trauma and congenial talipes equinovarus (clubfoot). Presently, it is not a common operation, however it still used in cases of a deformed calcaneus, foot paralysis following poliomyelitis, and also rigid clubfoot deformities that are secondary to spina bifida or arthrogryposis (AMC). The surgery is also performed in severe cases of pulverized or infected open fractures. Generally, the surgical procedure involves making an anterolateral incision, stripping the ligaments from both malleoli and the calcaneus so that the foot can be displaced posteriorly. The talus is then resected, and the foot is placed so that the lateral malleolus rests opposite the calcaneocuboid joint, and the medial malleolus lies just above and behind the navicular bone. The foot is held in place with a surgical pin or with Kirschner wire. After the operation, the patient wears an above-knee cast for six weeks, followed by a below-knee cast for eighteen weeks.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Basal_ganglia	Basal ganglia	A08.186.211.730.885.105	"The basal ganglia (or basal nuclei) are a group of nuclei of varied origin in the brains of vertebrates that act as a cohesive functional unit. They are situated at the base of the forebrain and are strongly connected with the cerebral cortex, thalamus and other brain areas. The basal ganglia are associated with a variety of functions, including voluntary motor control, procedural learning relating to routine behaviors or ""habits"" such as bruxism, eye movements, and cognitive, emotional functions. Currently popular theories implicate the basal ganglia primarily in action selection, that is, the decision of which of several possible behaviors to execute at a given time. Experimental studies show that the basal ganglia exert an inhibitory influence on a number of motor systems, and that a release of this inhibition permits a motor system to become active. The ""behavior switching"" that takes place within the basal ganglia is influenced by signals from many parts of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, which plays a key role in executive functions. The main components of the basal ganglia are the striatum, the globus pallidus, the substantia nigra, the nucleus accumbens, and the subthalamic nucleus. The largest component, the striatum, receives input from many brain areas but sends output only to other components of the basal ganglia. The pallidum receives input from the striatum, and sends inhibitory output to a number of motor-related areas. The substantia nigra is the source of the striatal input of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which plays an important role in basal ganglia function. The subthalamic nucleus receives input mainly from the striatum and cerebral cortex, and projects to the globus pallidus. Each of these areas has a complex internal anatomical and neurochemical organization. The basal ganglia play a central role in a number of neurological conditions, including several movement disorders. The most notable are Parkinson's disease, which involves degeneration of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra pars compacta, and Huntington's disease, which primarily involves damage to the striatum. Basal ganglia dysfunction is also implicated in some other disorders of behavior control such as Tourette syndrome, hemiballismus, obsessiveâ€“compulsive disorder, and Wilson's disease. The basal ganglia have a limbic sector whose components are assigned distinct names: the nucleus accumbens, ventral pallidum, and ventral tegmental area. There is considerable evidence that this limbic part plays a central role in reward learning, particularly a pathway from the ventral tegmental area to the nucleus accumbens that uses the neurotransmitter dopamine. A number of highly addictive drugs, including cocaine, amphetamine, and nicotine, are thought to work by increasing the efficacy of this dopamine signal. There is also evidence implicating overactivity of the VTA dopaminergic projection in schizophrenia."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thoracic_vertebrae	thoracic vertebrae	A02.835.232.834.892	In vertebrates, thoracic vertebrae compose the middle segment of the vertebral column, between the cervical vertebrae and the lumbar vertebrae. In humans, they are intermediate in size between those of the cervical and lumbar regions; they increase in size as one proceeds down the spine, the upper vertebrae being much smaller than those in the lower part of the region. They are distinguished by the presence of facets on the sides of the bodies for articulation with the heads of the ribs, and facets on the transverse processes of all, except the eleventh and twelfth, for articulation with the tubercles of the ribs. Humans have 12, but numbers vary greatly; for example, most marsupials have 13, but koalas have only 11. 12 to 15 is common among mammals, with 18 to 20 in horses, tapirs, rhinoceroses, and elephants, and extremes in mammals are marked by certain sloths with 25 and cetaceans with 9. By convention, the human thoracic vertebrae are numbered, with the first one (T1) located closest to the skull and higher numbered vertebrae (T2-T12) proceeding away from the skull and down the spine.

The uvea, also called the uveal layer, uveal coat, uveal tract, or vascular tunic, is the pigmented middle of the three concentric layers that make up an eye. The name is possibly a reference to its reddish-blue or almost black colour, wrinkled appearance and grape-like size and shape when stripped intact from a cadaveric eye. Its use as a technical term in anatomy and ophthalmology is relatively modern.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adrenal_gland	Adrenal Gland	A06.407.071	In mammals, the adrenal glands (also known as suprarenal glands) are endocrine glands that sit at the top of the kidneys; in humans, the right adrenal gland is triangular shaped, while the left adrenal gland is semilunar shaped. They are chiefly responsible for releasing hormones in response to stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids such as cortisol and catecholamines such as epinephrine (adrenaline) and norepinephrine. They also produce androgens. The adrenal glands affect kidney function through the secretion of aldosterone, a hormone involved in regulating the osmolarity of blood plasma.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anterior_pituitary	Anterior pituitary gland	A06.407.747.608	A major organ of the endocrine system, the anterior pituitary, also called the adenohypophysis, is the glandular, anterior lobe that together with the posterior lobe makes up the pituitary gland (the other part of the pituitary being the posterior pituitary). The anterior pituitary regulates several physiological processes including stress, growth, reproduction and lactation. Its regulatory functions are achieved through the secretion of various peptide hormones that act on target organs including the adrenal gland, liver, bone, thyroid gland, and gonads. The anterior pituitary itself is regulated by the hypothalamus and by negative feedback from these target organs. Disorders of the anterior pituitary are generally classified by the presence of over- or underproduction of pituitary hormones. For example, a prolactinoma is a pituitary adenoma that overproduces prolactin. In Sheehan's syndrome of postpartum hypopituitarism, the anterior pituitary uniformly malfunctions and underproduces all hormones. Proper function of the anterior pituitary and of the organs it regulates can often be ascertained via blood tests that measure hormone levels.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontal_lobe	Frontal lobe	A08.186.211.730.885.213.270	The frontal lobe is an area in the brain of mammals, located at the front of each cerebral hemisphere and positioned anterior to (in front of) the parietal lobe and superior and anterior to the temporal lobes. It is separated from the parietal lobe by a space between tissues called the central sulcus, and from the temporal lobe by a deep fold called the lateral (Sylvian) sulcus. The precentral gyrus, forming the posterior border of the frontal lobe, contains the primary motor cortex, which controls voluntary movements of specific body parts. The frontal lobe contains most of the dopamine-sensitive neurons in the cerebral cortex. The dopamine system is associated with reward, attention, short-term memory tasks, planning, and motivation. Dopamine tends to limit and select sensory information arriving from the thalamus to the fore-brain. A report from the National Institute of Mental Health says a gene variant that reduces dopamine activity in the prefrontal cortex is related to poorer performance and inefficient functioning of that brain region during working memory tasks, and to slightly increased risk for schizophrenia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ileocecal_valve	Ileocecal valve	A03.556.124.684.249.400	The ileocecal valve, or ileocaecal valve, is a papillose structure with physiological sphincter muscle situated at the junction of the small intestine (ileum) and the large intestine, with recent evidence indicating an anatomical sphincter may also be present in humans. Its critical function is to limit the reflux of colonic contents into the ileum. The ileocecal valve is distinctive because it is the only site in the GI tract which is used for Vitamin B12 and bile acid absorption. Functionally, roughly two litres of fluid enters the colon daily through the ileocecal valve.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parathyroid_gland	Parathyroid glands	A06.407.560	The parathyroid glands are small endocrine glands in the neck that produce parathyroid hormone. Humans usually have four parathyroid glands, which are usually located on the rear surface of the thyroid gland, or, in rare cases, within the thyroid gland itself or in the chest. Parathyroid glands control the amount of calcium in the blood and within the bones.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pituitary_gland	Pituitary gland	A06.407.747	In vertebrate anatomy the pituitary gland, or hypophysis, is an endocrine gland about the size of a pea and weighing 5 grams in humans. It is not a part of the brain. It is a protrusion off the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain, and rests in a small, bony cavity covered by a dural fold . The pituitary is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence via a small tube called the infundibular stem. The pituitary fossa, in which the pituitary gland sits, is situated in the sphenoid bone in the middle cranial fossa at the base of the brain. The pituitary gland secretes nine hormones that regulate homeostasis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pons	Pons	A08.186.211.132.810.428.600	"The pons is a structure located on the brain stem, named after the Latin word for ""bridge"" or the 16th-century Italian anatomist and surgeon Costanzo Varolio (pons Varolii). It is cranial to the medulla oblongata, caudal to the midbrain, and ventral to the cerebellum. In humans and other bipeds, this means it is above the medulla, below the midbrain, and anterior to the cerebellum. This white matter includes tracts that conduct signals from the cerebrum down to the cerebellum and medulla, and tracts that carry the sensory signals up into the thalamus. The pons in humans measures about 2.5Â cm or 1 inch in length. Most of it appears as a broad anterior bulge rostral to the medulla. Posteriorly, it consists mainly of two pairs of thick stalks called cerebellar peduncles. They connect the cerebellum to the pons and midbrain. The pons contains nuclei that relay signals from the forebrain to the cerebellum, along with nuclei that deal primarily with sleep, respiration, swallowing, bladder control, hearing, equilibrium, taste, eye movement, facial expressions, facial sensation, and posture. Within the pons is the pneumotaxic center, a nucleus in the pons that regulates the change from inspiration to expiration. The pons is implicated in sleep paralysis, and also plays a role in generating dreams."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Radius_(bone)	Radius	A02.835.232.087.090.700	"The radius or radial bone is one of the two large bones of the forearm, the other being the ulna. It extends from the lateral side of the elbow to the thumb side of the wrist and runs parallel to the ulna, which exceeds it in length and size. It is a long bone, prism-shaped and slightly curved longitudinally. The radius articulates with the capitulum of the humerus, the radial notch and the head of the ulna. The corresponding bone in the lower leg is the tibia. The word radius is Latin for ""ray"". In the context of the radius bone, a ray can be thought of rotating around an axis line extending diagonally from center of capitulum to the center of distal ulna. While the ulna is the major contributor to the elbow joint, the radius primarily contributes to the wrist joint. The radius is named so because the radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle). The ulna acts as the center point to the circle because when the arm is rotated the ulna does not move. The radius (bone) acts like the radius (of a circle) because it rotates around the ulna and the far end (where it joins to the bones of the hand), known as the styloid process of the radius, is the distance from the ulna (center of the circle) to the edge of the radius (the circle)."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tongue	Tongue	A03.556.500.885	The tongue is a muscular hydrostat on the floors of the mouths of most vertebrates which manipulates food for mastication. It is the primary organ of taste (gustation), as much of the upper surface of the tongue is covered in papillae and taste buds. It is sensitive and kept moist by saliva, and is richly supplied with nerves and blood vessels. In humans a secondary function of the tongue is phonetic articulation. The tongue also serves as a natural means of cleaning one's teeth. The ability to perceive different tastes is not localised in different parts of the tongue, as is widely believed. This error arose because of misinterpretation of some 19th-century research.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ciliary_body	Ciliary body	A09.371.894.280	The ciliary body is the circumferential tissue inside the eye composed of the ciliary muscle and ciliary processes. It is triangular in horizontal section and is coated by a double layer, the ciliary epithelium. This epithelium produces the aqueous humor. The inner layer is transparent and covers the vitreous body, and is continuous from the neural tissue of the retina. The outer layer is highly pigmented, continuous with the retinal pigment epithelium, and constitutes the cells of the dilator muscle. This double membrane is often regarded to be continuous with the retina and a rudiment of the embryological correspondent to the retina. The inner layer is unpigmented until it reaches the iris, where it takes on pigment. The retina ends at the ora serrata. It is part of the uveal tractâ€” the layer of tissue which provides most of the nutrients in the eye. It extends from the ora serrata to the root of the iris. There are three sets of ciliary muscles in the eye, the longitudinal, radial, and circular muscles. They are near the front of the eye, above and below the lens. They are attached to the lens by connective tissue called the zonule of Zinn, and are responsible for shaping the lens to focus light on the retina.

The isthmus (the bridge between the two lobes of the thyroid) is located inferior to the cricoid cartilage. The thyroid gland controls how quickly the body uses energy, makes proteins, and controls how sensitive the body is to other hormones. It participates in these processes by producing thyroid hormones, the principal ones being triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine which can sometimes be referred to as tetraiodothyronine (T4). These hormones regulate the rate of metabolism and affect the growth and rate of function of many other systems in the body. T3 and T4 are synthesized from both iodine and tyrosine. The thyroid also produces calcitonin, which plays a role in calcium homeostasis. Hormonal output from the thyroid is regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) produced by the anterior pituitary, which itself is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) produced by the hypothalamus. The thyroid gets its name from the Greek word for ""shield"", due to the shape of the related thyroid cartilage.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epithalamus	Epithalamus	A08.186.211.577.200	The epithalamus is a (dorsal) posterior segment of the diencephalon (a segment in the middle of the brain also containing the hypothalamus and the thalamus) which includes the habenula and their interconnecting fibers the habenular commissure, the stria medullaris and the pineal body. Its function is the connection between the limbic system to other parts of the brain.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Globus_pallidus	Globus pallidus	A08.186.211.730.885.105.487.397	"The globus pallidus (Latin for ""pale globe"") also known as paleostriatum, is a sub-cortical structure of the brain. It is part of the telencephalon, but retains close functional ties with the subthalamus - both of which are part of the extrapyramidal motor system. The globus pallidus is a major component of the basal ganglia core along with the striatum and its direct target, the substantia nigra. The latter are made up of similar neuronal elements, have similar afferents from the dorsal striatum and have a similar synaptology; neither receives cortical afferents."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glottis	Glottis	A04.329.364	The glottis is defined as the combination of the vocal folds (vocal cords) and the space in between the folds.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Incisor	Incisor	A14.549.167.860.425	"Incisors (from Latin incidere, ""to cut"") are the first four front teeth present in heterodont mammals. They are located in the premaxilla above and on the mandible below."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inferior_vena_cava	Inferior vena cava	A07.231.908.949.648	The inferior vena cava (or IVC), also known as the posterior vena cava, is the large vein that carries de-oxygenated blood from the lower half of the body into the right atrium of the heart. It is posterior to the abdominal cavity and runs alongside of the vertebral column on its right side (i.e. it is a retroperitoneal structure). It enters the right atrium at the lower right, back side of the heart.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Jejunum	Jejunum	A03.556.124.684.500	"The jejunum is the middle section of the small intestine in most higher vertebrates, including mammals, reptiles, and birds. In fish, the divisions of the small intestine are not as clear and the terms middle intestine or mid-gut may be used instead of jejunum. The jejunum lies between the duodenum and the ileum. The change from the duodenum to the jejunum is usually defined as the Duodenojejunal flexure and is attached, and thus ""hung up"", to the ventricle by the ligament of Treitz. In adult humans, the small intestine is usually between 5.5 and 6m long, 2.5m of which is the jejunum. The pH in the jejunum is usually between 7 and 9 (neutral or slightly alkaline). If the jejunum is impacted by blunt force the emesis reflex will be initiated. The jejunum and the ileum are suspended by mesentery which gives the bowel great mobility within the abdomen. It also contains circular and longitudinal smooth muscle which helps to move food along by a process known as peristalsis."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Malleus	Malleus	A09.246.397.247.524	The malleus or hammer is a hammer-shaped small bone or ossicle of the middle ear which connects with the incus and is attached to the inner surface of the eardrum. The word is Latin for hammer. It transmits the sound vibrations from the eardrum to the incus. The malleus is unique to mammals, and evolved from a lower jaw bone in basal amniotes called the articular, which still forms part of the jaw joint in reptiles and birds. Embryologically it is derived from the first pharyngeal arch along with the rest of the bones of mastication, such as the maxilla and mandible. Sound waves hit the ear drum and, together with the other bones, it tends to transmit the vibrations from the ear drum to the cochlea, and then to the brain, which enables hearing.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Midbrain	Mesencephalon	A08.186.211.132.659	"The midbrain or mesencephalon (from the Greek mesos - middle, and enkephalos - brain) is a portion of the central nervous system associated with vision, hearing, motor control, sleep/wake, arousal, and temperature regulation. Anatomically, it comprises the tectum (or corpora quadrigemina), tegmentum, the ventricular mesocoelia (or ""iter""), and the cerebral peduncles, as well as several nuclei and fasciculi. Caudally the mesencephalon adjoins the pons and rostrally it adjoins the diencephalon (Thalamus, hypothalamus, etc.). The midbrain is located below the cerebral cortex, and above the hindbrain placing it near the center of the brain."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ossicles	Ossicles	A09.246.397.247	"The ossicles (also called auditory ossicles) are the three smallest bones in the human body, the malleus, the incus and the stapes. They are contained within the middle ear space and serve to transmit sounds from the air to the fluid-filled labyrinth. The absence of the auditory ossicles would constitute a moderate-to-severe hearing loss. The term ""ossicles"" literally means ""tiny bones"" and commonly refers to the auditory ossicles, though the term may refer to any small bone throughout the body."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Otolith	Otolith	A09.246.631.909.625.125.680	An otolith, (Î¿Ï„Î¿-, oto-, ear + Î»Î¹Î¸Î¿Ï‚, lithos, a stone), also called statoconium or otoconium is a structure in the saccule or utricle of the inner ear, specifically in the vestibular labyrinth of vertebrates. The saccule and utricle, in turn, together make the otolith organs. They are sensitive to gravity and linear acceleration. Because of their orientation in the head, the utricle is sensitive to a change in horizontal movement, and the saccule gives information about vertical acceleration (such as when in an elevator).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parietal_lobe	Parietal lobe	A08.186.211.730.885.213.670	The parietal lobe is a part of the brain positioned above (superior to) the occipital lobe and behind (posterior to) the frontal lobe. The parietal lobe integrates sensory information from different modalities, particularly determining spatial sense and navigation. For example, it comprises somatosensory cortex and the dorsal stream of the visual system. This enables regions of the parietal cortex to map objects perceived visually into body coordinate positions. Several portions of the parietal lobe are important in language processing. Just posterior to the central sulcus lies the Postcentral Gyrus. This area of the cortex is responsible for somatosensation. Somatosensory cortex can be illustrated as a distorted figure - the homunculus (little man), in which the body parts are rendered according to how much of the somatosensory cortex is devoted to them. The name comes from the overlying parietal bone, which is named from the Latin paries-, wall.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pulmonary_valve	Pulmonary valve	A07.541.510.738	The pulmonary valve (sometimes referred to as the pulmonic valve) is the semilunar valve of the heart that lies between the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery and has three cusps. Similar to the aortic valve, the pulmonary valve opens in ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle rises above the pressure in the pulmonary artery. At the end of ventricular systole, when the pressure in the right ventricle falls rapidly, the pressure in the pulmonary artery will close the pulmonary valve. The closure of the pulmonary valve contributes the P2 component of the second heart sound (S2). The right heart is a low-pressure system, so the P2 component of the second heart sound is usually softer than the A2 component of the second heart sound. However, it is physiologically normal in some young people to hear both components separated during inhalation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Scaphoid_bone	scaphoid bone	A02.835.232.087.319.150.750	The scaphoid bone is one of the carpal bones of the wrist. It is situated between the hand and forearm on the thumb side of the wrist (also called the lateral or radial side). It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel. The scaphoid bone is the largest bone of the proximal row of wrist bones, its long axis being from above downward, lateralward, and forward. It is approximately the size and shape of a medium cashew.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sertoli_cell	Sertoli cell	A05.360.444.849.789	A Sertoli cell (a kind of sustentacular cell) is a 'nurse' cell of the testes that is part of a seminiferous tubule. It is activated by follicle-stimulating hormone and has FSH-receptor on its membranes. It is specifically located in the convoluted seminiferous tubules (since this is the only place in the testes where the spermatozoa is produced).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Temporomandibular_joint	Temporomandibular joint	A02.835.583.861	"The temporomandibular joint is the joint of the jaw and is frequently referred to as TMJ. There are two TMJs, one on each side, working in unison. The name is derived from the two bones which form the joint: the upper temporal bone which is part of the cranium, and the lower jaw bone called the mandible. The unique feature of the TMJs is the articular disc. The disc is composed of fibrocartilagenous tissue (like the firm and flexible elastic cartilage of the ear) which is positioned between the two bones that form the joint. The TMJs are one of the few synovial joints in the human body with an articular disc, another being the sternoclavicular joint. The disc divides each joint into two. The lower joint compartment formed by the mandible and the articular disc is involved in rotational movementâ€”this is the initial movement of the jaw when the mouth opens. The upper joint compartment formed by the articular disk and the temporal bone is involved in translational movementâ€”this is the secondary gliding motion of the jaw as it is opened widely. The part of the mandible which mates to the under-surface of the disc is the condyle and the part of the temporal bone which mates to the upper surface of the disk is the glenoid (or mandibular) fossa. Pain or dysfunction of the temporomandibular joint is commonly referred to as ""TMJ"", when in fact, TMJ is really the name of the joint, and Temporomandibular joint disorder (or dysfunction) is abbreviated TMD. This term is used to refer to a group of problems involving the TMJs and the muscles, tendons, ligaments, blood vessels, and other tissues associated with them. Some practitioners might include the neck, the back and even the whole body in describing problems with the TMJs."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thyroid_cartilage	Thyroid cartilage	A02.165.257.625.870	"The thyroid cartilage is the largest of the nine cartilages that make up the laryngeal skeleton, the cartilage structure in and around the trachea that contains the larynx. It is composed of two plate-like laminae that fuse on the anterior side of the cartilage to form a peak, called the laryngeal prominence. This prominence is often referred to as the ""pomus Adami"" or ""Adam's apple"". The laryngeal prominence is more prominent in adult male than female because of the difference in the size of the angle: 90Â° in male and 120Â° in female. The lip of the thyroid cartilage just superior to the laryngeal prominence is called the superior thyroid notch, while the notch inferior to the thyroid angle is called the inferior thyroid notch. Its posterior border is elongated both inferiorly and superiorly to form the superior horn of thyroid cartilage and inferior horn of thyroid cartilage."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Utricle_(ear)	Utricle	A09.246.631.909.625	The utricle, or utriculus, along with the saccule is one of the two otolith organs located in the vertebrate inner ear. The utricle and the saccule are parts of the balancing apparatus (membraneous labyrinth) located within the vestibule of the bony labyrinth (small oval chamber). These use small stones and a viscous fluid to stimulate hair cells to detect motion and orientation.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Aortic_body	Aortic body	A08.800.550.700.120.600.050	"In the human heart, the aortic body (""glomus aorticum"") is one of several small clusters of chemoreceptors, baroreceptors, and supporting cells located along the aortic arch."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anterior_jugular_vein	Anterior jugular vein	A07.231.908.498	The anterior jugular vein begins near the hyoid bone by the confluence of several superficial veins from the submaxillary region. It descends between the median line and the anterior border of the Sternocleidomastoideus, and, at the lower part of the neck, passes beneath that muscle to open into the termination of the external jugular, or, in some instances, into the subclavian vein. It varies considerably in size, bearing usually an inverse proportion to the external jugular; most frequently there are two anterior jugulars, a right and left; but sometimes only one. Its tributaries are some laryngeal veins, and occasionally a small thyroid vein. Just above the sternum the two anterior jugular veins communicate by a transverse trunk, the venous jugular arch, which receive tributaries from the inferior thyroid veins; each also communicates with the internal jugular. There are no valves in this vein.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lumbar_plexus	Lumbar plexus	A08.800.800.720.450	The lumbar plexus is a nervous plexus in the lumbar region of the body which forms part of the lumbosacral plexus. It is formed by the ventral divisions of the first four lumbar nerves (L1-L4) and from contributions of the subcostal nerve (T12), which is the last thoracic nerve. Additionally, the ventral rami of the fourth lumbar nerve pass communicating branches, the lumbosacral trunk, to the sacral plexus. The nerves of the lumbar plexus pass in front of the hip joint and mainly support the anterior part of the thigh. The plexus is formed lateral to the intervertebral foramina and passes through psoas major. Its smaller motor branches are distributed directly to psoas major, while the larger branches leave the muscle at various sites to run obliquely downward through the pelvic area to leave the pelvis under the inguinal ligament, with the exception of the obturator nerve which exits the pelvis through the obturator foramen.

The bone is also found in many other mammals, and is homologous with the ""third distal carpal"" of reptiles and amphibians. The etymology derives from the Latin capitÄﾁtus, ""having a head,"" from capit-, meaning ""head."""
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Intercostal_nerves	Intercostal nerves	A08.800.800.720.800.350	The intercostal nerves are part of the somatic nervous system, and arise from anterior divisions (rami anteriores; ventral divisions) of the thoracic spinal nerves from T1 to T11. The intercostal nerves are distributed chiefly to the thoracic pleura and abdominal peritoneum and differ from the anterior divisions of the other spinal nerves in that each pursues an independent course without plexus formation. The first two nerves supply fibers to the upper limb in addition to their thoracic branches; the next four are limited in their distribution to the parietes of the thorax; the lower five supply the parietes of the thorax and abdomen. The 7th intercostal nerve terminates at the xyphoid process, at the lower end of the sternum. The 10th intercostal nerve terminates at the umbilicus. The twelfth thoracic is distributed to the abdominal wall and groin. Unlike the nerves from the autonomic nervous system that innervate the visceral pleura of the thoracic cavity, the intercostal nerves arise from the somatic nervous system. This enables them to control the contraction of muscles, as well as provide specific sensory information regarding the skin and parietal pleura. This explains why damage to the internal wall of the thoracic cavity can be felt as a sharp pain localized in the injured region. Damage to the visceral pleura is experienced as an un-localized ache.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lesser_omentum	Lesser omentum	A01.047.025.600.573	The lesser omentum (small omentum; gastrohepatic omentum; Latin: omentum minus) is the double layer of peritoneum that extends from the liver to the lesser curvature of the stomach and the start of the duodenum.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Meissner's_plexus	Meissner&#39;s plexus	A08.800.050.050.850	The nerves of the small intestines are derived from the plexuses of parasympathetic nerves around the superior mesenteric artery. From this source, they run to the myenteric plexus of nerves and ganglia situated between the circular muscular fibers and the longitudinal muscle fibers of the muscularis externa. From this a secondary plexus, the plexus of the submucosa (Meissner's plexus, submucous plexus, submucosal plexus, plexus submucosus) is derived, and it is formed by branches that have perforated the circular muscular fibers. This plexus lies in the submucous coat of the intestine; it also contains ganglia from which nerve fibers pass to the muscularis mucosae and to the mucous membrane. The nerve bundles of the submucous plexus are finer than those of the myenteric plexus. Its function is to innervate cells in the epithelial layer and the smooth muscle of the muscularis mucosae.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Oocyte	Oocyte	A05.360.490.690.680	An oocyte, oÃ¶cyte, ovocyte, or rarely ocyte, is a female gametocyte or germ cell involved in reproduction. In other words, it is an immature ovum, or egg cell. An oocyte is produced in the ovary during female gametogenesis. The female germ cells produce a primordial germ cell (PGC) which undergoes mitosis to form an oogonium. During oogenesis the oogonium becomes a primary oocyte.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Round_window	Round window	A09.246.631.246.814	The round window is one of the two openings into the inner ear. It is closed off from the middle ear by the round window membrane, which vibrates with opposite phase to vibrations entering the inner ear through the oval window. It allows fluid in the cochlea to move, which in turn ensures that hair cells of the basilar membrane will be stimulated and that audition will occur.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Serous_membrane	Serous Membrane	A10.615.789	In anatomy, serous membrane (or serosa) is a smooth membrane consisting of a thin layer of cells, which secrete serous fluid, and a thin epithelial layer. Serous membranes line and enclose several body cavities, known as serous cavities, where they secrete a lubricating fluid which reduces friction from muscle movement. Serosa is not to be confused with adventitia, a connective tissue layer which binds together structures rather than reducing friction between them. The serous membrane covering the heart and lining the mediastinum is referred to as the pericardium, the serous membrane lining the thoracic cavity and surrounding the lungs is referred to as the pleura, and that lining the abdominopelvic cavity and the viscera is referred to as the peritoneum.

The following are their average measurements: vertical height, 2.2 cm. ; transverse breadth, 2 cm. ; antero-posterior depth, 2.2 cm.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Submandibular_duct	Submandibular duct	A03.556.500.760.640	"The submandibular duct (Wharton's duct, submaxillary duct) is one of the salivary ducts. It is about 5Â cm. long, and its wall is much thinner than that of the parotid duct. It begins by numerous branches from the deep surface of the gland, and runs forward between the mylohyoideus, hyoglossus, and genioglossus, then between the sublingual gland and the genioglossus, and opens by a narrow orifice on the summit of a small papilla at the side of the frenulum linguÃ¦. On the hyoglossus it lies between the lingual and hypoglossal nerves, but at the anterior border of the muscle the lingual nerve passes inferior and medial to the submandibular duct. ; the terminal branches of the lingual nerve ascend on its medial side. It drains saliva from the submandibular glands and sublingual glands to the sublingual caruncle at the base of the tongue. It was initially described by the English anatomist Thomas Wharton and is sometimes referred to by his name. This is the duct from which a hungry person, preparing to take a first bite of food, might accidentally eject a spray of salivary fluid, or, alternatively, intentionally do so in a process called ""gleeking."""
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tibial_nerve	Tibial nerve	A08.800.800.720.450.760.820	The tibial nerve is a branch of the sciatic nerve. The tibial nerve passes through the popliteal fossa to pass below the arch of soleus. In the popliteal fossa the nerve gives off branches to gastrocnemius, popliteus, soleus and plantaris muscles, an articular branch to the knee joint, and a cutaneous branch that will become the sural nerve. The sural nerve is joined by fibres from the common fibular nerve and runs down the calf to supply the lateral side of the foot. Below the soleus muscle the nerve lies close to the tibia and supplies the tibialis posterior, the flexor digitorum longus and the flexor hallucis longus. The nerve passes into the foot running posterior to the medial malleolus. Here it is bound down by the flexor retinaculum in company with the posterior tibial artery.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Venae_cavae	Venae Cavae Oris	A07.231.908.949	The superior and inferior vena cava are collectively called the venae cavae. They are the veins that return deoxygenated blood from the body, into the heart. They both empty into the right atrium. The inferior vena cava (or caudal vena cava in animals) travels up alongside the abdominal aorta with blood from the lower part of the body (see # 11 in the diagram). It is the largest vein in the body. The superior vena cava (or cranial vena cava in animals) is above the heart, and forms from a convergence of the left and right brachiocephalic veins that contain blood from the head and the arms (see # 3 in the diagram).

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Xiphoid_process	Xiphoid process	A02.835.232.904.766.825	The xiphoid process /ËˆzÉªfÉ”Éªd/, or xiphisternum or metasternum, is a small cartilaginous process (extension) of the lower part of the sternum which is usually ossified in the adult human. By age 15 to 29, the xiphoid usually fuses to the body of the sternum with a fibrous joint. Unlike the synovial articulation of major joints, this is non-movable. Much the way the first seven ribs articulate with the sternum, the cartilage in the celiac plexus joins on the xiphoid process, reinforcing it, and indirectly attaches the costal cartilage to the sternum. In newborn babies and young (especially slender) infants, the tip of the xiphoid process may be both seen and felt as a lump just below the sternal notch. The xiphoid process is considered to be at the level of the 9th thoracic vertebra and the T6 dermatome.

Canine tooth File:Azawakh K9. jpg This dog's longer pointed cuspids or ""fangs"" show why they are particularly associated with canines. Latin dentes canini Gray's subject #242 1116 MeSH Cuspid In mammalian oral anatomy, the canine teeth, also called cuspids, dogteeth, fangs, or (in the case of those of the upper jaw) eye teeth, are relatively long, pointed teeth. However, they can appear more flattened, causing them to resemble incisors and leading them to be called incisiform. They evolved and are used primarily for firmly holding food in order to tear it apart, and occasionally as weapons. They are often the largest teeth in a mammal's mouth. Most species that develop them normally have four per individual, two in the upper jaw and two in the lower, separated within each jaw by its incisors; humans and dogs are examples. In most animals, canines are the anterior-most teeth in the maxillary bone. Narwhals provide an extreme example, where one canine tooth, usually the left, erupts into a long spiral horn up to 9 feet long. The four canines in humans are the two maxillary canines and the two mandibular canines."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Choroid	Choroid	A09.371.894.223	The choroid, also known as the choroidea or choroid coat, is the vascular layer of the eye, containing connective tissue, and lying between the retina and the sclera. The human choroid is thickest at the far extreme rear of the eye (at 0.2Â mm), while in the outlying areas it narrows to 0.1Â mm. The choroid provides oxygen and nourishment to the outer layers of the retina. Along with the ciliary body and iris, the choroid forms the uveal tract. The structure of the choroid is generally divided into four layers: Haller's layer - outermost layer of the choroid consisting of larger diameter blood vessels; Sattler's layer - layer of medium diameter blood vessels; Choriocapillaris - layer of capillaries; and Bruch's membrane - innermost layer of the choroid.

The basic activity of this brain region is considered to be orchestration of thoughts and actions in accordance with internal goals. The most typical psychological term for functions carried out by the prefrontal cortex area is executive function. Executive function relates to abilities to differentiate among conflicting thoughts, determine good and bad, better and best, same and different, future consequences of current activities, working toward a defined goal, prediction of outcomes, expectation based on actions, and social ""control"" (the ability to suppress urges that, if not suppressed, could lead to socially unacceptable outcomes). Many authors have indicated an integral link between a person's personality and the functions of the prefrontal cortex."

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cerebral_peduncle	Cerebral peduncle	A08.186.211.132.659	Mainly, the three common areas that give rise to the cerebral peduncles are the cortex, the spinal cord and the cerebellum. The cerebral peduncle, by most classifications, is everything in the mesencephalon except the tectum. The region includes the midbrain tegmentum, crus cerebri and pretectum. By this definition, the cerebral peduncles are also known as the basis pedunculi, while the large ventral bundle of efferent fibers is referred to as the crus cerebri or the pes pedunculi. There are numerous nerve tracts located within this section of the brainstem. Of note, in the cerebral peduncular loop fibers from motor areas of the brain project to the cerebral peduncle and then project to various thalamic nuclei. Important fibers running through the cerebral peduncles include the corticospinal tract and the corticobulbar tract, among others. This area contains many nerve tracts conveying motor information to and from the brain to the rest of the body.

The transverse sinuses (left and right lateral sinuses), within the human head, are two areas beneath the brain which allow blood to drain from the back of the head. They run laterally in a groove along the interior surface of the occipital bone. They drain from the confluence of sinuses to the sigmoid sinuses, which ultimately connect to the internal jugular vein. See diagram (at right): labeled under the brain as """" . The transverse sinuses are of large size and begin at the internal occipital protuberance; one, generally the right, being the direct continuation of the superior sagittal sinus, the other of the straight sinus. Each transverse sinus passes lateralward and forward, describing a slight curve with its convexity upward, to the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, and lies, in this part of its course, in the attached margin of the tentorium cerebelli; it then leaves the tentorium and curves downward and medialward (an area sometimes referred to as the sigmoid sinus) to reach the jugular foramen, where it ends in the internal jugular vein. In its course it rests upon the squama of the occipital, the mastoid angle of the parietal, the mastoid part of the temporal, and, just before its termination, the jugular process of the occipital; the portion which occupies the groove on the mastoid part of the temporal is sometimes termed the sigmoid sinus. The transverse sinuses are frequently of unequal size, with the one formed by the superior sagittal sinus being the larger; they increase in size as they proceed, from back to center. On transverse section, the horizontal portion exhibits a prismatic form, the curved portion has a semicylindrical form. They receive the blood from the superior petrosal sinuses at the base of the petrous portion of the temporal bone; they communicate with the veins of the pericranium by means of the mastoid and condyloid emissary veins; and they receive some of the inferior cerebral and inferior cerebellar veins, and some veins from the diploÃ«.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Sinoatrial_node	Sinoatrial node	A07.541.409.819	The sinoatrial node (also commonly spelled sinuatrial node, abbreviated SA node or SAN, also called the sinus node) is the impulse-generating (pacemaker) tissue located in the right atrium of the heart, and thus the generator of normal sinus rhythm. It is a group of cells positioned on the wall of the right atrium, near the entrance of the superior vena cava. These cells are specialized cardiomyocytes. Though they possess some contractile filaments, they do not contract robustly. The SAN was first described in 1907 by Arthur Keith and Martin Flack.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tectorial_membrane_(cochlea)	Tectorial membrane	A09.246.631.246.292.906	The tectorial membrane (TM) is one of two acellular gels in the cochlea of the inner ear, the other being the basilar membrane (BM). The TM is located above the sulcus spiralis internus and the spiral organ of Corti and extends along the longitudinal length of the cochlea parallel to the BM. Radially the TM is divided into three zones, the limbal, middle and marginal zones. Of these the limbal zone is the thinnest (transversally) and overlies the auditory teeth of Huschke with its inside edge attached to the spiral limbus. The marginal zone is the thickest (transversally) and is divided from the middle zone by Hensen's Stripe. It overlies the sensory inner hair cells and electrically-motile outer hair cells of the organ of Corti and during acoustic stimulation stimulates the inner hair cells through fluid coupling, and the outer hair cells via direct connection to their tallest stereocilia. The TM is a gel-like structure containing 97% water. Its dry weight is composed of collagen (50%), non-collagenous glycoproteins (25%) and proteoglycans (25%). Three inner-ear specific glycoproteins are expressed in the TM, Î±-tectorin, Î²-tectorin and otogelin. Of these proteins Î±-tectorin and Î²-tectorin form the striated sheet matrix that regularly organises the collagen fibres. Due to the increased structural complexity of the TM relative to other acullular gels (such as the otolithic membranes), its mechanical properties are consequently significantly more complex. They have been experimentally shown to be radially and longitudinally anisotropic and to exhibit viscoelastic properties. The mechanical role of the tectorial membrane in hearing is yet to be fully understood, and traditionally was neglected or downplayed in many models of the cochlea. However, recent genetic, mechanical and mathematical studies have highlighted the importance of the TM for healthy auditory function in mammals. Mice that lack expression of individual glycoproteins exhibit hearing abnormalities, including, most notably, enhanced frequency selectivity in Tecb mice, which lack expression of Î²-tectorin. In vitro investigations of the mechanical properties of the TM have demonstrated the ability of isolated sections of TM to support travelling waves at acoustically relevant frequencies. This raises the possibility that the TM may be involved in the longitudinal propagation of energy in the intact cochlea.

It receives fecal material from the ileum, and connects to the ascending colon of the large intestine. It is separated from the ileum by the ileocecal valve (ICV) or Bauhin's valve. It is also separated from the colon by the cecocolic junction. The appendix is connected to the cecum. While the cecum is usually peritoneal, the ascending colon is retroperitoneal.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cheek	Cheek	A01.456.505.173	"Cheeks constitute the area of the face below the eyes and between the nose and the left or right ear. They may also be referred to as jowls. ""Buccal"" means relating to the cheek. In humans, the region is innervated by the buccal nerve. The area between the inside of the cheek and the teeth and gums is called the buccal pouch or buccal cavity and forms part of the mouth. Cheeks are fleshy in humans and other mammals, the skin being suspended by the chin and the jaws, and forming the lateral wall of the human mouth, visibly touching the cheekbone below the eye. Some animals such as squirrels and hamsters use the buccal pouch to carry food or other items. In vertebrates, markings on the cheek area (malar stripes/spots/... ), particularly immediately beneath the eye, often serve as important distinguishing features between species or individuals. The inside of the cheek is lined with a mucous membrane (buccal mucosa, part of the oral mucosa). It is the most common location from which a DNA sample can be taken (during a cheek swab). The cheeks are covered externally by hairy skin, and internally by stratified squamous epithelium. This is mostly smooth, but may have aborally directed papillae. The mucosa is supplied with secretions from the Buccal glands, which are arranged in superior and inferior groups. In carnivores, the superior buccal gland is large and discrete: the Zygomatic gland. During mastication (chewing), the cheeks and tongue between them serve to keep the food between the teeth."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chin	Chin	A01.456.505.259	In the human anatomy, the chin is the lowermost part of the face. The area of the chin is known anatomically as the mental region. It tends to be more pointed and triangular in human females, while more square shaped in human males. It is formed by the lower front of the mandible. In humans there is a wide variety of chin structures, e.g. cleft chin. The chin developed as a point of muscular attachment facilitating minute movements of the lips associated with speech. In human evolution, the chin is a cladistic apomorphy, partially defining anatomically modern humans as distinct from archaic forms. Non-human anthropoid apes have a simian shelf for example. The elephant is the only other animal considered to display such a feature, although this leads to debate over the use of the term. Whilst it is agreed that the chin emerged during the Middle and Late Pleistocene, its origin and biomechanical significance are the subjects of controversy. Prominent hypotheses include buttressing the jaw against stresses resulting from speech or chewing as well as simple sexual selection through mate choice. With the advent of more advanced computational facilities, finite element analyses have been used to support hypotheses involving mechanical stress. On the other hand increased availability of data regarding sexual dimorphism in chins has also lent support to the sexual selection hypothesis as sexual dimorphism is more difficult to explain under other regimes. It is possible that multiple causal factors have played a role in the evolution of this bony protuberance.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Knee	Knee	A01.378.610.450	The knee joint joins the thigh with the lower leg and consists of two articulations: one between the femur and tibia, and one between the femur and patella. It is the largest joint in the human body and is very complicated. The knee is a mobile trocho-ginglymus (a pivotal hinge joint), which permits flexion and extension as well as a slight medial and lateral rotation. Since in humans the knee supports nearly the whole weight of the body, it is vulnerable to both acute injury and the development of osteoarthritis. It is often grouped into tibiofemoral and patellofemoral components. (The fibular collateral ligament is often considered with tibiofemoral components.)

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Shoulder	Shoulder	D012782	"The human shoulder is made up of three bones: the clavicle (collarbone), the scapula (shoulder blade), and the humerus (upper arm bone) as well as associated muscles, ligaments and tendons. The articulations between the bones of the shoulder make up the shoulder joints. The major joint of the shoulder is the glenohumeral joint, which ""shoulder joint"" generally refers to. In human anatomy, the shoulder joint comprises the part of the body where the humerus attaches to the scapula, the head sitting in the glenoid fossa. The shoulder is the group of structures in the region of the joint. There are two kinds of cartilage in the joint. The first type is the white cartilage on the ends of the bones (called articular cartilage) which allows the bones to glide and move on each other. When this type of cartilage starts to wear out (a process called arthritis), the joint becomes painful and stiff. The labrum is a second kind of cartilage in the shoulder which is distinctly different from the articular cartilage. This cartilage is more fibrous or rigid than the cartilage on the ends of the ball and socket. Also, this cartilage is also found only around the socket where it is attached. The shoulder must be mobile enough for the wide range actions of the arms and hands, but also stable enough to allow for actions such as lifting, pushing and pulling. The compromise between mobility and stability results in a large number of shoulder problems not faced by other joints such as the hip."

The intercostal muscles are mainly involved in the mechanical aspect of breathing. These muscles help expand and shrink the size of the chest cavity when you breathe. There are three principal layers; external intercostal muscles aid in quiet and forced inhalation. They originate on ribs 1-11 and have their insertion on ribs 2-12. The external intercostals are responsible for the elevation of the ribs, and expanding the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity. internal intercostal muscles aid in forced expiration (quiet expiration is a passive process). They originate on ribs 2-12 and have their insertions on ribs 1-11. The internal intercostals are responsible for the depression of the ribs decreasing the transverse dimensions of the thoracic cavity. innermost intercostal muscle, the deep layers of the internal intercostal muscles which are separated from them by a neurovascular bundle. This in turn is composed of: transversus thoracis muscle intercostal space subcostalis muscle Both the external and internal muscles are innervated by the intercostal nerves, are supplied by the intercostal arteries, and are drained by the intercostal veins. Their fibers run in opposite directions. The scaleni, which also move the chest wall and have a function in inhalation, are also intercostal muscles, just not one of the three principal layers.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cloaca_(embryology)	Cloaca	A13.223	The cloaca is a structure in the development of the urinary and reproductive organs. The hind-gut is at first prolonged backward into the body-stalk as the tube of the allantois; but, with the growth and flexure of the tail-end of the embryo, the body-stalk, with its contained allantoic tube, is carried forward to the ventral aspect of the body, and consequently a bend is formed at the junction of the hind-gut and allantois. This bend becomes dilated into a pouch, which constitutes the endodermal cloaca; into its dorsal part the hind-gut opens, and from its ventral part the allantois passes forward. At a later stage the Wolffian duct and MÃ¼llerian duct open into its ventral portion. The cloaca is, for a time, shut off from the anterior by a membrane, the cloacal membrane, formed by the apposition of the ectoderm and endoderm, and reaching, at first, as far forward as the future umbilicus. Behind the umbilicus, however, the mesoderm subsequently extends to form the lower part of the abdominal wall and pubic symphysis. By the growth of the surrounding tissues the cloacal membrane comes to lie at the bottom of a depression, which is lined by ectoderm and named the ectodermal cloaca.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Third_metacarpal_bone	Third metacarpal bone	A02.835.232.087.319.550	The third metacarpal bone (metacarpal bone of the middle finger) is a little smaller than the second. The dorsal aspect of its base presents on its radial side a pyramidal eminence, the styloid process, which extends upward behind the capitate; immediately distal to this is a rough surface for the attachment of the extensor carpi radialis brevis muscle. The carpal articular facet is concave behind, flat in front, and articulates with the capitate. On the radial side is a smooth, concave facet for articulation with the second metacarpal, and on the ulnar side two small oval facets for the fourth metacarpal.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thoracic_aorta	Thoracic aorta	A07.231.114.056.372	The thoracic aorta is contained in the posterior mediastinal cavity. It begins at the lower border of the fourth thoracic vertebra where it is continuous with the aortic arch, and ends in front of the lower border of the twelfth thoracic vertebra, at the aortic hiatus in the diaphragm where it becomes the abdominal aorta. At its commencement, it is situated on the left of the vertebral column; it approaches the median line as it descends; and, at its termination, lies directly in front of the column. The vessel describes a curve which is concave forward; as the branches given off from it are small, its diminution in size is insignificant. It has a radius of approximately 1.16Â cm.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Bone_marrow	Bone marrow	D001853	Bone marrow is the flexible tissue found in the interior of bones. In humans, red blood cells are produced in the heads of long bones, in a process known as hematopoesis. On average, bone marrow constitutes 4% of the total body mass of humans; in an adult weighing 65 kilograms, bone marrow accounts for approximately 2.6 kilograms . The hematopoietic compartment of bone marrow produces approximately 500 billion blood cells per day, which use the bone marrow vasculature as a conduit to the body's systemic circulation. Bone marrow is also a key component of the lymphatic system, producing the lymphocytes that support the body's immune system.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Buttocks	Buttocks	A01.378.610.100	The buttocks are two rounded portions of the anatomy, located on the posterior of the pelvic region of apes and humans, and many other bipeds or quadrupeds, and comprise a layer of fat superimposed on the gluteus maximus and gluteus medius muscles. Physiologically, the buttocks enable weight to be taken off the feet while sitting. In many cultures, they play a role in sexual attraction. Many cultures have also used them as a safe target for corporal punishment. There are several connotations of buttocks in art, fashion, culture and humor, and the English language is replete with many popular synonyms.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dentate_gyrus	Dentate gyrus	A08.186.211.577.405.200	The dentate gyrus is part of the hippocampal formation. It is thought to contribute to the formation of new episodic,memories, among other functions. It is notable as being one of a select few brain structures currently known to have high rates of neurogenesis in adult rats. The dentate gyrus cells receive excitatory input from the entorhinal cortex, in the medial temporal lobe, through the perforant path into the molecular layer. This input activates pyramidal cells among the CA4 and CA3 pyramidal neurons (CA stands for cornu ammonis), which are components of Ammon's horn within the hippocampus. Tracts exit CA3 neurons via the Schaffer collaterals and activate CA1 pyramidal cells, allowing the dentate gyrus to be in a position to control the flow of information within the hippocampus.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Elbow	Elbow	A02.835.583.290	In primates, including humans, the elbow joint is the synovial hinge joint between the humerus in the upper arm and the radius and ulna in the forearm which allows the hand to be moved towards and away from the body. The superior radioulnar joint shares joint capsule with the elbow joint but plays no functional role at the elbow. The elbow region includes prominent landmarks such as the olecranon (the bony prominence at the very tip of the elbow), the elbow pit, and the lateral and medial epicondyles.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Face	Face	A01.456.505	The face is a central sense organ complex, normally on the ventral surface of the head for animals that have one. It can, depending on the definition in the human case, include the hair, forehead, eyebrow, eyelashes, eyes, nose, ears, cheeks, mouth, lips, philtrum, temple, teeth, skin, and chin. The face has uses of expression, appearance, and identity amongst others. It also has different senses like olfaction, taste, hearing, and vision.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Frontal_sinus	Frontal sinus	A04.531.621.387	Sinuses are mucosa-lined airspaces within the bones of the face and skull. The frontal sinuses are situated behind the superciliary arches.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypothalamus	Hypothalamus	A08.186.211.730.385.357	The hypothalamus (from Greek á½‘Ï€ÏŒ = under and Î¸Î¬Î»Î±Î¼Î¿Ï‚ = room, chamber) is a portion of the brain that contains a number of small nuclei with a variety of functions. One of the most important functions of the hypothalamus is to link the nervous system to the endocrine system via the pituitary gland (hypophysis). The hypothalamus is located below the thalamus, just above the brain stem. In the terminology of neuroanatomy, it forms the ventral part of the diencephalon. All vertebrate brains contain a hypothalamus. In humans, it is roughly the size of an almond. The hypothalamus is responsible for certain metabolic processes and other activities of the autonomic nervous system. It synthesizes and secretes certain neurohormones, often called ]]hypothalamic-releasing hormones, and these in turn stimulate or inhibit the secretion of pituitary hormones. The hypothalamus controls body temperature, hunger, important aspects of parenting and attachment behaviors, thirst, fatigue, sleep, and circadian cycles.

The human rectum is about 12 centimetres long, and begins at the rectosigmoid junction (the end of the sigmoid colon), at the level of the third sacral vertebra or the sacral promontory depending upon what definition is used. Its caliber is similar to that of the sigmoid colon at its commencement, but it is dilated near its termination, forming the rectal ampulla. It terminates at the level of the anorectal ring (the level of the puborectalis sling) or the dentate line, again depending upon which definition is used. In humans, the rectum is followed by the anal canal, before the gastrointestinal tract terminates at the anal verge."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Right_atrium	Right atrium	A07.541.358	"The right atrium (in older texts termed the ""right auricle"", which now means the right atrial appendage) is one of four chambers in the hearts of mammals and archosaurs. It receives deoxygenated blood from the superior and inferior vena cava and the coronary sinus, and pumps it into the right ventricle through the tricuspid valve. Attached to the right atrium is the right auricular appendix. Atria facilitate circulation primarily by allowing uninterrupted venous flow to the heart, preventing the inertia of interrupted venous flow that would otherwise occur at each ventricular systole. The right atrium is composed of a smooth intercaval part and a muscular part (formed by pectinate muscles) separated by an internal ridge called the crista terminalis and an external groove (sulcus terminalis). The muscular part is derived from the primitive atrium while the smooth part is formed from the embryological sinus venosus."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Small_intestine	Small intestine	A03.556.124.684	"The small intestine (or small bowel) is the part of the gastrointestinal tract following the stomach and followed by the large intestine, and is where much of the digestion and absorption of food takes place. In invertebrates such as worms, the terms ""gastrointestinal tract"" and ""large intestine"" are often used to describe the entire intestine. This article is primarily about the human gut, though the information about its processes is directly applicable to most placental mammals. The primary function of the small intestine is the absorption of nutrients and minerals found in food. (A major exception to this is cows; for information about digestion in cows and other similar mammals, see ruminants.)"
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spleen	spleen	A10.549.700	The spleen is an organ found in virtually all vertebrate animals. Similar in structure to a large lymph node, it acts primarily as a blood filter. Thus, life is possible after the spleen is removed. The spleen plays important roles in regard to red blood cells (also referred to as erythrocytes) and the immune system. It removes old red blood cells and holds a reserve of blood in case of hemorrhagic shock and also recycles iron. As a part of the mononuclear phagocyte system, it metabolizes hemoglobin removed from senescent erythrocytes. The globin portion of hemoglobin is degraded to its constitutive amino acids, and the heme portion is metabolized to bilirubin, which is removed in the liver. The spleen synthesizes antibodies in its white pulp and removes antibody-coated bacteria and antibody-coated blood cells by way of blood and lymph node circulation. A study published in 2009 using mice found that the spleen contains in its reserve half of the body's monocytes within the red pulp. These monocytes, upon moving to injured tissue (such as the heart), turn into dendritic cells and macrophages while promoting tissue healing. The spleen is a center of activity of the reticuloendothelial system and can be considered analogous to a large lymph node, as its absence causes a predisposition to certain infections. In humans, the spleen is brownish in color and is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thymus	Thymus	A10.549.750	"The thymus is a specialized organ of the immune system. The thymus ""educates"" T-lymphocytes, which are critical cells of the adaptive immune system. Each T cell attacks a foreign substance which it identifies with its receptor. T cells have receptors which are generated by randomly shuffling gene segments. Each T cell attacks a different antigen. T cells that attack the body's own proteins are eliminated in the thymus. Thymic epithelial cells express major proteins from elsewhere in the body. First T cells undergo ""Positive Selection"" whereby the cell comes in contact with self-MHC expressed by thymic epithelial cells, those with no interaction are destroyed. Second, the T cell undergoes ""Negative Selection"" by interacting with thymic dendritic cell whereby T cells with high affinity interaction are are eliminated through [apoptosis apoptosis] (to avoid autoimmunity), and those with intermediate affinity survive. The thymus is composed of two identical lobes and is located anatomically in the anterior superior mediastinum, in front of the heart and behind the sternum. Histologically, the thymus can be divided into a central medulla and a peripheral cortex which is surrounded by an outer capsule. The cortex and medulla play different roles in the development of T-cells. Cells in the thymus can be divided into thymic stromal cells and cells of hematopoietic origin (derived from bone marrow resident hematopoietic stem cells). Developing T-cells are referred to as thymocytes and are of hematopoietic origin. Stromal cells include thymic cortical epithelial cells, thymic medullary epithelial cells, and dendritic cells. The thymus provides an inductive environment for development of T-lymphocytes from hematopoietic progenitor cells. In addition, thymic stromal cells allow for the selection of a functional and self-tolerant T-cell repertoire. Therefore, one of the most important roles of the thymus is the induction of central tolerance. The thymus is largest and most active during the neonatal and pre-adolescent periods. By the early teens, the thymus begins to atrophy and thymic stroma is replaced by adipose (fat) tissue. Nevertheless, residual T lymphopoiesis continues throughout adult life."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Tunica_intima	Tunica intima	A07.231.330.800	The tunica intima (or just intima) is the innermost layer of an artery or vein. It is made up of one layer of endothelial cells and is supported by an internal elastic lamina. The endothelial cells are in direct contact with the blood flow. The inner coat (tunica intima) can be separated from the middle by a little maceration, or it may be stripped off in small pieces; but, on account of its friability, it cannot be separated as a complete membrane. It is a fine, transparent, colorless structure which is highly elastic, and, after death, is commonly corrugated into longitudinal wrinkles. The inner coat consists of: A layer of pavement endothelium, the cells of which are polygonal, oval, or fusiform, and have very distinct round or oval nuclei. This endothelium is brought into view most distinctly by staining with silver nitrate. A subendothelial layer, consisting of delicate connective tissue with branched cells lying in the interspaces of the tissue; in arteries of less than 2 mm. in diameter the subendothelial layer consists of a single stratum of stellate cells, and the connective tissue is only largely developed in vessels of a considerable size. An elastic or fenestrated layer, which consists of a membrane containing a net-work of elastic fibers, having principally a longitudinal direction, and in which, under the microscope, small elongated apertures or perforations may be seen, giving it a fenestrated appearance. It was therefore called by Henle the fenestrated membrane. This membrane forms the chief thickness of the inner coat, and can be separated into several layers, some of which present the appearance of a network of longitudinal elastic fibers, and others a more membranous character, marked by pale lines having a longitudinal direction. In minute arteries the fenestrated membrane is a very thin layer; but in the larger arteries, and especially in the aorta, it has a very considerable thickness.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Celiac_plexus	Celiac plexus	A08.800.050.050.150	The celiac plexus or coeliac plexus, also known as the solar plexus because of its radiating nerve fibers, is a complex network of nerves located in the abdomen, where the celiac trunk, superior mesenteric artery, and renal arteries branch from the abdominal aorta. It is behind the stomach and the omental bursa, and in front of the crura of the diaphragm, on the level of the first lumbar vertebra. The plexus is formed (in part) by the greater and lesser splanchnic nerves of both sides, and also parts of the right vagus nerve. The celiac plexus proper consists of the celiac ganglia with a network of interconnecting fibers. The aorticorenal ganglia are often considered to be part of the celiac ganglia, and thus, part of the plexus.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Organ_of_Corti	Organ of Corti	A09.246.631.246.577	The organ of Corti, found only in mammals, is part of the cochlea of the inner ear and is provided with hair cells or auditory sensory cells. It evolved from the basilar papilla found in all tetrapods, except for a few derived species that have lost it. The organ was named after the Italian anatomist Marquis Alfonso Giacomo Gaspare Corti (1822â€“1876), who conducted microscopic research of the mammalian auditory system.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Premolar	Premolar	A14.549.167.860.150	The premolar teeth are transitional teeth located between the canine and molar teeth. In humans, there are two premolars per quadrant, making eight premolars total in the mouth. They have at least two cusps. Premolars can be considered as a 'transitional tooth' during chewing, or mastication. It has properties of both the anterior canines and posterior molars, and so food can be transferred from the canines to the premolars and finally to the molars for grinding, instead of directly from the canines to the molars. The premolars in humans are the maxillary first premolar, maxillary second premolar, mandibular first premolar, and the mandibular second premolar. There is always one large buccal cusp, especially so in the mandibular first premolar. The lower second premolar almost always presents with two lingual cusps. Molar teeth by definition are permanent teeth distal to the canines, preceded by deciduous premolars. In primitive placental mammals there are four premolars per quadrant. The most mesial two have been lost in Catarrhines. Paleontologists refer to human premolars as Pm3 and Pm4.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saccule	Saccule	A09.246.631.909.625	The saccule is a bed of sensory cells situated in the inner ear. The saccule translates head movements into neural impulses which the brain can interpret. The saccule is sensitive to linear translations of the head, specifically movements up and down (for example, moving on an elevator). When the head moves vertically, the sensory cells of the saccule are disturbed and the neurons connected to them begin transmitting impulses to the brain. These impulses travel along the vestibular portion of the eighth cranial nerve to the vestibular nuclei in the brainstem. The vestibular system is important in maintaining balance, or equilibrium. The vestibular system includes the saccule, utricle, and the three semicircular canals. The vestibule is the name of the fluid-filled, membranous duct than contains these organs of balance. The vestibule is encased in the temporal bone of the skull.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Superior_colliculus	Superior colliculus	A08.186.211.132.659.237.816	"The optic tectum or simply tectum is a paired structure that forms a major component of the vertebrate midbrain. In mammals, this structure is more commonly called the superior colliculus, but, even in mammals, the adjective tectal is commonly used. The tectum is a layered structure, with a number of layers that vary by species. The superficial layers are sensory-related, and receive input from the eyes as well as other sensory systems. The deep layers are motor-related, capable of activating eye movements as well as other responses. There are also intermediate layers, with multi-sensory cells and motor properties. The general function of the tectal system is to direct behavioral responses toward specific points in egocentric (""body-centered"") space. Each layer of the tectum contains a topographic map of the surrounding world in retinotopic coordinates, and activation of neurons at a particular point in the map evokes a response directed toward the corresponding point in space. In primates, the tectum (""superior colliculus"") has been studied mainly with respect to its role in directing eye movements. Visual input from the retina, or ""command"" input from the cerebral cortex, create a ""bump"" of activity in the tectal map, which, if strong enough, induces a saccadic eye movement. Even in primates, however, the tectum is also involved in generating spatially directed head turns, arm-reaching movements, and shifts in attention that do not involve any overt movements. In other species, the tectum is involved in a wide range of responses, including whole-body turns in walking rats, swimming fishes, or flying birds; tongue-strikes toward prey in frogs; fang-strikes in snakes; etc. In some non-mammal species, including fish and birds, the tectum is one of the largest components of the brain. In mammals, and especially primates, the massive expansion of the cerebral cortex reduces the tectum (""superior colliculus"") to a much smaller fraction of the whole brain. Even there, however, it remains very important in terms of function as the primary integrating center for eye movements. Note on terminology: the use by the literature of different terms for mammals and non-mammals, for what is really the same structure, creates problems for an article that attempts to encompass the full range of vertebrate species. There does not seem to be any way to handle this without causing either confusion or annoyance to some readers. The approach taken in this article is to follow the literature by using the term ""superior colliculus"" when discussing mammals, and ""optic tectum"" when discussing either specific non-mammalian species or vertebrates in general."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinal_canal	Spinal canal	A02.835.232.834.803	The spinal canal (or vertebral canal or spinal cavity) is the space in vertebrae through which the spinal cord passes. It is a process of the dorsal human body cavity. This canal is enclosed within the vertebral foramen of the vertebrae. In the intervertebral spaces, the canal is protected by the ligamentum flavum posteriorly and the posterior longitudinal ligament anteriorly. The outermost layer of the meninges, the dura mater, is closely associated with the arachnoid which in turn is loosely connected to the innermost layer of the meninges, the pia mater. The meninges divide the spinal canal into the epidural space and the subarachnoid space. The pia mater is closely attached to the spinal cord. A subdural space is generally only present due to trauma and/or pathological situations. The subarachnoid space is filled with cerebrospinal fluid and contains the vessels that supply the spinal cord, namely the anterior spinal artery and the paired posterior spinal arteries, accompanied by corresponding spinal veins. The spinal arteries form anastomoses known as the vasocorona of the spinal cord. The epidural space contains loose fatty tissue, and a network of large, thin-walled blood vessels called the internal vertebral venous plexuses. The spinal canal was first described by Jean Fernel.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Adenoid	Pharyngeal tonsil	A10.549.100	The adenoid, also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil, is a mass of lymphatic tissue situated posterior to the nasal cavity, in the roof of the nasopharynx, where the nose blends into the throat. Normally, in children, it forms a soft mound in the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx, just above and behind the uvula.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chorioallantoic_membrane	Chorioallantoic membrane	A16.254.300.400	The chorioallantoic membrane â€” also called the chorioallantois or abbreviated to CAM â€” is a vascular membrane found in eggs of some amniotes, such as birds and reptiles. It is formed by the fusion of the mesodermal layers of two developmental structures: the allantois and the chorion. In mammals, this structure forms the placenta. Three different layers compose the chorioallantoic membrane; these are called the chorionic epithelium, the mesenchyme and the allantoic epithelium. Blood capillaries and sinuses are found between epithelial cells of the chorionic layer, allowing close contact (within 0.2 Î¼m) with air found in pores of the shell membrane of the egg. As a result, the chorioallantoic membrane allows exchange of gases, such as oxygen, to developing embryos. During embryonic development of birds, the chorioallantoic membrane also plays an essential role in bone formation by transporting calcium into the embryo from the eggshell. Chorioalloantoic membranes from developing chicken eggs are routinely used in biological and biomedical research to investigate development, angiogenesis, tumors, and to propagate and investigate viruses or helminths.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cytotrophoblast	Cytotrophoblast	A16.254.085.162	The cytotrophoblast (or layer of Langhans) is the inner layer of the trophoblast. It is interior to the syncytiotrophoblast and external to the wall of the blastocyst in a developing embryo. The cytotrophoblast is considered to be the trophoblastic stem cell because the layer surrounding the blastocyst remains while daughter cells differentiate and proliferate to function in multiple roles. There are two lineages that cytotrophoblastic cells may differentiate through: fusion and invasive. The fusion lineage yields syncytiotrophoblast and the invasive lineage yields interstitial cytotrophoblast cells. Cytotrophoblastic cells play an important role in the implantation of a newly fertilized egg in the uterus.

It is located between the stomodeum and the first pharyngeal groove.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Mesonephros	Mesonephros	A16.254.500	The mesonephros is one of three excretory organs that develop in vertebrates. It serves as the main excretory organ of aquatic vertebrates and as a temporary kidney in reptiles, birds, and mammals. The mesonephros is included in the Wolffian body after Caspar Friedrich Wolff who described it in 1759.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Paramesonephric_duct	Paramesonephric duct	A16.254.570	MÃ¼llerian ducts (or paramesonephric ducts) are paired ducts of the embryo that run down the lateral sides of the urogenital ridge and terminate at the MÃ¼llerian eminence in the primitive urogenital sinus. In the female, they will develop to form the Fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and the upper two-thirds of the vagina; in the male, they are lost. These ducts are made of tissue of mesodermal origin.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pharyngeal_arch	Pharyngeal arch	A16.254.160	In the development of vertebrate animals, the pharyngeal arches (which develop into the branchial arches or gill arches in fish) are anlage for a multitude of structures. In humans, they develop during the fourth week in utero as a series of mesodermal outpouchings on the left and right sides of the developing pharynx. In fish, the branchial arches support the gills.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Primitive_streak	Primitive streak	A16.254.412	The primitive streak is a structure that forms during the early stages of avian, reptilian and mammalian embryonic development. The presence of the primitive streak will establish bilateral symmetry, determine the site of gastrulation and initiate germ layer formation. To form the streak, reptiles, birds and mammals arrange mesenchymal cells along the prospective midline, establishing the first embryonic axis, as well as the place where cells will ingress and migrate during the process of gastrulation and germ layer formation. The primitive streak extends through this midline and creates the antero-posterior body axis, becoming the first symmetry-breaking event in the embryo, and marks the beginning of gastrulation. This process involves the ingression of mesoderm and endoderm progenitors and their migration to their ultimate position, where they will differentiate into the three germ layers that will give rise to all the tissues of the adult organism.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Somite	Somite	A16.254.425.660.750	"A somite is a division of the body of an animal. In vertebrates, somites are bilaterally paired blocks of mesoderm that form along the anterior-posterior axis of the developing embryo in segmented animals. In vertebrates, somites give rise to skeletal muscle, cartilage, tendons, endothelial cells, and dermis. The word ""somite"" is also used in place of the word ""metamere. "" In this definition, the somite is a homologously paired structure in an animal body plan, such as is visible in annelids and arthropods."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Syncytiotrophoblast	Syncytiotrophoblast	A16.254.085.162	"Syncytiotrophoblast (from the Greek 'syn'- ""together""; 'cytio'- ""of cells""; 'tropho'- ""nutrition""; 'blast'- ""bud"") is the epithelial covering of the highly vascular embryonic placental villi, which invades the wall of the uterus to establish nutrient circulation between the embryo and the mother. It is a unique tissue in that it is a multi-nucleated, terminally differentiated syncytium, extending to 13mÂ². It lacks proliferative capacity and instead is maintained by fusion of underlying cytotrophoblast cells. It is the outer syncytial layer of the trophoblasts and actively invades the uterine wall, rupturing maternal capillaries and thus establishing an interface between maternal blood and embryonic extracellular fluid, facilitating passive exchange of material between the mother and the embryo. The syncytiotrophoblast secretes progesterone in addition to human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and human placental lactogen (HPL); hCG prevents degeneration of the corpus luteum. Progesterone serves to maintain the integrity of the uterine lining and, until the syncytiotrophoblast is mature enough to secrete enough progesterone to support pregnancy (in the fourth month of embryonic development), it is aided by the corpus luteum graviditatis."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trophoblast	Trophoblast	A16.254.085.162	"Trophoblasts are cells forming the outer layer of a blastocyst, which provide nutrients to the embryo and develop into a large part of the placenta. They are formed during the first stage of pregnancy and are the first cells to differentiate from the fertilized egg. This layer of trophoblasts is also collectively referred to as ""the trophoblast"", or, after gastrulation, the trophectoderm, as it is then contiguous with the ectoderm of the embryo."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Truncus_arteriosus_(embryology)	Truncus arteriosus	A07.541.278.930	The truncus arteriosus and bulbus cordis are divided by the aorticopulmonary septum. The truncus arteriosus gives rise to the ascending aorta and the pulmonary trunk. The caudal end of the bulbus cordis gives rise to the smooth parts (outflow tract) of the left and right ventricles (aortic vestibule & conus arteriosus respectively). The cranial end of the bulbus cordis (also known as the conus cordis) gives rise to the aorta and pulmonary trunk with the truncus arteriosus. This makes its appearance in three portions. (1) Two distal ridge-like thickenings project into the lumen of the tube: the truncal and bulbar ridges. These increase in size, and ultimately meet and fuse to form a septum, which takes a spiral course toward the proximal end of the truncus arteriosus. It divides the distal part of the truncus into two vessels, the aorta and pulmonary artery, which lie side by side above, but near the heart the pulmonary artery is in front of the aorta. (2) Four endocardial cushions appear in the proximal part of the truncus arteriosus in the region of the future semilunar valves; the manner in which these are related to the aortic septum is described below. (3) Two endocardial thickeningsâ€”anterior and posteriorâ€”develop in the bulbus cordis and unite to form a short septum; this joins above with the aortic septum and below with the ventricular septum. The septum grows down into the ventricle as an oblique partition, which ultimately blends with the ventricular septum in such a way as to bring the bulbus cordis into communication with the pulmonary artery, and through the latter with the sixth pair of aortic arches; while the left ventricle is brought into continuity with the aorta, which communicates with the remaining aortic arches.

In humans, the ultimobranchial body is an embryological structure that gives rise to the calcitonin-producing cellsâ€”also called parafollicular cells or C cellsâ€”of the thyroid gland. In humans, this body is a derivative of the ventral recess of the fourth pharyngeal pouch (or fifth)
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Urachus	Urachus	A16.254.835	The urachus is a fibrous remnant of the allantois, a canal that drains the urinary bladder of the fetus that joins and runs within the umbilical cord.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vitelline_membrane	Vitelline membrane	A16.631.886	The vitelline membrane is a structure directly adjacent to the outer surface of the plasma membrane of an ovum. It is composed mostly of protein fibers, with protein receptors needed for sperm binding which, in turn, are bound to sperm plasma membrane receptors. The species-specificity between these receptors contributes to prevention of breeding between different species. It is called zona pellucida in mammals. As soon as the spermatozoon fuses with the ovum, signal transduction occurs, resulting in an increase of cytoplasmic calcium ions. This itself triggers the cortical reaction, which results in depositing several substances onto the vitelline membrane through exocytosis of the cortical granules, transforming it into a hard layer called the â€œfertilization membraneâ€ﾝ, which serves as a barrier inaccessible to other spermatozoa. This phenomenon is the slow block to polyspermy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Yolk_sac	Yolk sac	A10.615.284.981	The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to an embryo, providing early nourishment in the form of yolk in bony fishes, sharks, reptiles, birds, and primitive mammals. It functions as the developmental circulatory system of the human embryo, before internal circulation begins.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cochlear_nerve	Cochlear nerve	A08.800.800.120.910.120	The cochlear nerve (also auditory or acoustic nerve) is a nerve in the head that carries signals from the cochlea of the inner ear to the brain. It is part of the vestibulocochlear nerve, the 8th cranial nerve which is found in higher vertebrates; the other portion of the 8th cranial nerve is the vestibular nerve which carries spatial orientation information from the semicircular canals. The cochlear nerve is a sensory nerve, one which conducts to the brain information about the environment, in this case acoustic energy impinging on the tympanic membrane (sound waves reaching the ear drum). The cochlear nerve arises from within the cochlea and extends to the brainstem, where its fibers make contact with the cochlear nucleus, the next stage of neural processing in the auditory system.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Facial_nerve	Facial nerve	A08.800.800.120.250	The facial nerve is the seventh (VII) of twelve paired cranial nerves. It emerges from the brainstem between the pons and the medulla, and controls the muscles of facial expression, and functions in the conveyance of taste sensations from the anterior two-thirds of the tongue and oral cavity. It also supplies preganglionic parasympathetic fibers to several head and neck ganglia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hypoglossal_nerve	Hypoglossal nerve	A08.800.800.120.330	The hypoglossal nerve is the twelfth cranial nerve (XII), leading to muscles of the tongue. It is called hypoglossal nerve because it is below the tongue.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Trochlear_nerve	Trochlear nerve	A08.800.800.120.800	The trochlear nerve (the fourth cranial nerve, also called the fourth nerve, IV) is a motor nerve (a â€œsomatic efferentâ€ﾝ nerve) that innervates a single muscle: the superior oblique muscle of the eye. The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects. It is the smallest nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. It has the greatest intracranial length. Other than the optic nerve (cranial nerve II), it is the only cranial nerve that decussates (crosses to the other side) before innervating its target. Finally, it is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal aspect of the brainstem. Homologous trochlear nerves are found in all jawed vertebrates. The unique features of the trochlear nerve, including its dorsal exit from the brainstem and its contralateral innervation, are seen in the primitive brains of sharks. The human trochlear nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vestibular_nerve	Vestibular nerve	A08.800.800.120.910.900	The vestibular nerve is one of the two branches of the Vestibulocochlear nerve (the cochlear nerve being the other). In humans the vestibular nerve transmits sensory information transmitted by vestibular hair cells located in the two otolith organs (the utricle and the saccule) and the three semicircular canals via the vestibular ganglion. Information from the otolith organs reflects gravity and linear accelerations of the head. Information from the semicircular canals reflects rotational movement of the head. Both are necessary for the sensation of body position and gaze stability in relation to a moving environment. Axons of the vestibular nerve synapse in the vestibular nucleus on the lateral floor and wall of the fourth ventricle in the pons and medulla. It arises from bipolar cells in the vestibular ganglion, ganglion of Scarpa, which is situated in the upper part of the outer end of the internal auditory meatus.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cisterna_magna	Cisterna magna	A08.186.566.166.686.351	The cisterna magna (or cerebellomedullary cistern) is one of three principal openings in the subarachnoid space between the arachnoid and pia mater layers of the meninges surrounding the brain. The openings are collectively referred to as cisterns. The cisterna magna is located between the cerebellum and the dorsal surface of the medulla oblongata. Cerebrospinal fluid produced in the fourth ventricle drains into the cisterna magna via the lateral apertures and median aperture. The two other principal cisterns are the pontine cistern located between the pons and the medulla, and the interpeduncular cistern located between the cerebral peduncles. Cerebral spinal fluid can also be obtained by puncture of the cisterna magna (cistern puncture).

As the rounded part of the upper stomach, it allows for an accumulation of stomach gases produced by chemical digestion. It will also store undigested food for up to 1 hour.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Interventricular_foramina_(neural_anatomy)	Interventricular foramina	A08.186.211.276	In the brain, the interventricular foramina (or foramina of Monro) are channels that connect the paired lateral ventricles with the third ventricle at the midline of the brain. As channels, they allow cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) produced in the lateral ventricles to reach the third ventricle and then the rest of the brain's ventricular system. They also contain choroid plexus, a specialized CSF-producing structure, that is continuous with that of the lateral and third ventricles.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Metacarpophalangeal_joint	Metacarpophalangeal joint	A02.835.583.345.512	The metacarpophalangeal joints (MCP) are of the condyloid kind, formed by the reception of the rounded heads of the metacarpal bones into shallow cavities on the proximal ends of the first phalanges, with the exception of that of the thumb, which is a saddle joint. Arthritis of the MCP is a distinguishing feature of Rheumatoid Arthritis, as opposed to the distal interphalangeal joint in osteoarthritis.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Eyelid	Eyelid	A01.456.505.420.504	"An eyelid is a thin fold of skin that covers and protects the eye. With the exception of the prepuce and the labia minora, it has the thinnest skin of the whole body. The levator palpebrae superioris muscle retracts the eyelid to ""open"" the eye. This can be either voluntarily or involuntarily. The human eyelid features a row of eyelashes which serve to heighten the protection of the eye from dust and foreign debris, as well as from perspiration. ""Palpebral"" (and ""blepharo"") means relating to the eyelids. Its key function is to regularly spread the tears and other secretions on the eye surface to keep it moist, since the cornea must be continuously moist. They keep the eyes from drying out when asleep. Moreover, the blink reflex protects the eye from foreign bodies."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femoral_artery	Femoral artery	A07.231.114.35	The femoral artery is a large artery in the thigh. It is a continuation of the external iliac artery and begins at the inguinal ligament. In this segment, it is also called the common femoral artery (arteria femoralis communis) and gives the deep femoral artery, which provides blood to the thigh. After the branching of the deep femoral artery, it is called the superficial femoral artery (arteria femoralis superficialis) in clinical parlance, because of its superficial course. It continues along the femur to provide blood to the arteries that circulate the knee and the foot and enters the adductor canal. After it emerges from the adductor canal through the adductor hiatus, it is named the popliteal artery.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glossopharyngeal_nerve	Glossopharyngeal nerve	A08.800.800.120.290	The glossopharyngeal nerve is the ninth (IX) of twelve pairs of cranial nerves (24 nerves total). It exits the brainstem out from the sides of the upper medulla, just rostral (closer to the nose) to the vagus nerve. The motor division of the glossopharyngeal nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata, while the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inguinal_canal	inguinal canal	A01.047.412	The inguinal canal is a passage in the anterior (toward the front of the body) abdominal wall which in men conveys the spermatic cord and in women the round ligament. The inguinal canal is larger and more prominent in men. Each person has two, on the left and right sides of the abdomen.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Pericardium	Pericardium	A07.541.795	"The pericardium (from the Greek Ï€ÎµÏﾁÎ¹, ""around"" and ÎºÎ¬ÏﾁÎ´Î¹Î¿Î½, ""heart"" /perikardion/) is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Psoas_minor_muscle	Psoas minor muscle	A02.633.567.825	The psoas minor is a long, slender skeletal muscle which, when present, is located anterior to the psoas major muscle. This muscle does not exist in about 40 to 50 percent of the human population.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Anterior_hypothalamic_nucleus	Anterior hypothalamic nucleus	A08.186.211.730.385.357.342.063	The anterior hypothalamic nucleus is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. Its function is thermoregulation (cooling) of the body. Damage or destruction of this nucleus causes hyperthermia. The anterior hypothalamus plays a role in regulating sleep. The anterior hypothalamic region is sometimes grouped with the preoptic area.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Apocrine_sweat_gland	Apocrine sweat gland	A10.336.899.206	An apocrine sweat gland is a sweat gland composed of a coiled secretory portion located at the junction of the dermis and subcutaneous fat, from which a straight portion inserts and secretes into the infundibular portion of the hair follicle. In humans, apocrine sweat glands are found only in certain locations of the body: the axillae (armpits), areola and nipples of the breast, ear canal, eyelids, wings of the nostril, perianal region, and some parts of the external genitalia. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Modified apocrine glands include the ciliary glands in the eyelids; the ceruminous glands, which produce ear wax; and the mammary glands, which produce milk. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} The rest of the body is covered by eccrine sweat glands. Most non-primate mammals, however, have apocrine sweat glands over the greater part of their body. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Domestic animals such as dogs and cats have apocrine glands at each hair follicle but eccrine glands only in foot pads and snout. Their apocrine glands, like those in humans, produce an odorless, oily, opaque secretion that gains its characteristic odor upon bacterial decomposition. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}} Eccrine glands on their paws increase friction and prevent them from slipping when fleeing from danger. {{#invoke:Footnotes|sfn}}
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chiasmal_syndrome	Optic chiasm	A08.800.800.120.680.600	Chiasmal syndrome is the set of signs and symptoms that are associated with lesions of the optic chiasm, manifesting as various impairment in the sufferer's visual field according to the location of the lesion along the optic nerve. Pituitary adenomas are the most common cause; however, chiasmal syndrome may be caused by cancer, or associated with other medical conditions such as multiple sclerosis and neurofibromatosis.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hip_pointer	Iliac Crest	A02.835.232.611.434	A hip pointer is a contusion on the pelvis caused by a direct blow or a bad fall at an iliac crest and / or hip bone and a bruise of the abdominal muscles (transverse and oblique abdominal muscles). Surrounding structures such as the tensor fascia lata and the greater trochanter may also be affected. The injury results from the crushing of soft tissue between a hard object and the iliac crest. Contact sports are a common cause of this type of injury, most often in football and hockey in general due to improper equipment and placement. The direct impact can cause an avulsion fracture where a portion of bone is removed by a muscle. The pain is due to the cluneal nerve that runs right along the iliac crest, which makes this a very debilitating injury. This pain can be felt when walking, laughing, coughing or even breathing deeply. A hip pointer bruise usually causes bleeding into the hip abductor muscles, which move legs sideways, away from the midline of the body. This bleeding into muscle tissue creates swelling and makes leg movement painful. The hematoma that occurs can potentially build on the femoral nerve or lateral cutaneous of the femur. This injury usually lasts from one to six weeks, depending on the damage. In most cases, patients recover completely. A full assessment should be undertaken to rule out the possibility of damage to abdominal organs.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dyschronometria	Cerebellum	A08.186.211.132.810.428.200	Dyschronometria is when a person can not accurately estimate the amount of time that has passed. This can be a sign of cerebellar ataxia. which is when the cerebellum has been damaged and does not function to its fullest ability. Lesions to the cerebellum can cause dyssynergia, dysmetria, dysdiadochokinesia, dysarthria, and ataxia of stance and gait. as well as a precursor for a patient who will be having a stroke. Dyschronometria is an autosomal dominant cerebellar ataxia (ADCA) which usually means the ataxia is a less debilitating than an autosomal recessive cerebellar ataxia, or an ataxia that is linked to the X-chromosome.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Glenohumeral_joint	Glenohumeral joint	A02.835.583.748	The glenohumeral joint, (from ancient Greek glene, eyeball, puppet, doll + -oid, 'form of', + Latin humerus, shoulder) or shoulder joint, is a multiaxial synovial ball and socket joint and involves articulation between the glenoid fossa of the scapula (shoulder blade) and the head of the humerus (upper arm bone). Due to the very limited interface of the humerus and scapula, it is the most mobile joint of the human body.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Islands_of_Calleja	Islands of Calleja	A08.186.211.577.699.400 NeuroLex = Islands of Calleja	The islands of Calleja (IC, ISC, or IClj) are a group of neural granule cells located within the ventral striatum in the brains of most animals. This region of the brain is part of the limbic system, where it aids in the reinforcing effects of reward-like activities. Within most species, the islands are specifically located within the olfactory tubercle; however, in primates, these islands are located within the nucleus accumbens, the reward center of the brain, since the olfactory tubercle has practically disappeared in the brains of primates. Both of these structures have been implicated in the processing of incentives as well as addictions to drugs. Projections to and from the islands supplement this knowledge with their involvement in the reward pathways for both cocaine and amphetamines.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Stapes	Stapes	A09.246.397.247.806	"The stapes is the stirrup-shaped small bone or ossicle in the middle ear which is attached through the incudostapedial joint to the incus laterally and to the fenestra ovalis, the ""oval window"", medially. Stapes means stirrup in Latin. The oval window is adjacent to the vestibule of the inner ear. The stapes is the smallest and lightest bone in the human body. It was described by the professor Giovanni Filippo Ingrassia in 1546 at the University of Naples."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Parotid_duct	Parotid duct	A03.556.500.760.640	The parotid duct, also known as Stensen's duct, is the route that saliva takes from the parotid gland into the mouth. It passes through the buccal fat, buccopharyngeal fascia, and buccinator muscle then opens into the vestibule of the mouth next to the maxillary second molar tooth. The buccinator acts as a valve that prevents inflation of the duct during blowing. Running along with the duct superiorly is the transverse facial artery and upper buccal nerve; running along with the duct inferiorly is the lower buccal nerve.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Popliteal_vein	Popliteal vein	A07.231.908.641	The popliteal vein is located behind the knee. Its course runs alongside the popliteal artery, but carries the blood from the knee joint and muscles in the thigh and calf back to the heart. Its origin is defined by the junction of the posterior tibial vein and anterior tibial vein. It drains the peroneal vein before reaching the knee joint and turns into the femoral vein when leaving the adductor canal (also known as Hunter's canal). The popliteal artery extends from the femoral artery behind the popliteal fossa which is the space behind the knee.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Cervical_vertebrae	Cervical vertebrae or Cervilar	A02.835.232.834.151	In vertebrates, cervical vertebrae are those vertebrae immediately inferior to the skull. Thoracic vertebrae in all mammalian species are defined as those vertebrae that also carry a pair of ribs, and lie caudal to the cervical vertebrae. Further caudally follow the lumbar vertebrae, which also belong to the trunk, but do not carry ribs. In reptiles, all trunk vertebrae carry ribs and are called dorsal vertebrae. In many species, though not in mammals, the cervical vertebrae bear ribs. In many other groups, such as lizards and saurischian dinosaurs, the cervical ribs are large; in birds, they are small and completely fused to the vertebrae. The transverse processes of mammals are homologous to the cervical ribs of other amniotes. In humans, cervical vertebrae are the smallest of the true vertebrae, and can be readily distinguished from those of the thoracic or lumbar regions by the presence of a foramen (hole) in each transverse process, through which passes the vertebral artery. The remainder of this article focuses upon human anatomy.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Acromioclavicular_joint	Acromio-clavicular joint	A02.835.583.032	The acromioclavicular joint, or AC joint, is a joint at the top of the shoulder. It is the junction between the acromion (part of the scapula that forms the highest point of the shoulder) and the clavicle.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ampulla_of_Vater	Ampulla of Vater	A03.159.183.079.300.950	The ampulla of Vater, also known as the hepatopancreatic ampulla, is formed by the union of the pancreatic duct and the common bile duct. The ampulla is specifically located at the major duodenal papilla. The ampulla of Vater is an important landmark, halfway along the second part of the duodenum, that marks the anatomical transition from foregut to midgut (and hence the point where the celiac trunk stops supplying the gut and the superior mesenteric artery takes over)..
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brachial_artery	Brachial artery	A07.231.114.139	The brachial artery is the major blood vessel of the (upper) arm. It is the continuation of the axillary artery beyond the lower margin of teres major muscle. It continues down the ventral surface of the arm until it reaches the cubital fossa at the elbow. It then divides into the radial and ulnar arteries which run down the forearm. In some individuals, the bifurcation occurs much earlier and the ulnar and radial arteries extend through the upper arm. The pulse of the brachial artery is palpable on the anterior aspect of the elbow, medial to the tendon of the biceps, and, with the use of a stethoscope and sphygmomanometer (blood pressure cuff) often used to measure the blood pressure. The brachial artery is closely related to the median nerve; in proximal regions, the median nerve is immediately lateral to the brachial artery. Distally, the median nerve crosses the medial side of the brachial artery and lies anterior to the elbow joint.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brachial_plexus	Brachial plexus	A08.800.800.720.050	The brachial plexus is a network of nerve fibers, running from the spine, formed by the ventral rami of the lower four cervical and first thoracic nerve roots. It proceeds through the neck, the axilla (armpit region), and into the arm. It is a network of nerves passing through the cervico-axillary canal to reach axilla and supplies brachium, antebrachium and hand.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Brachiocephalic_artery	Brachiocephalic artery	A07.231.908.130	The brachiocephalic artery (or brachiocephalic trunk or innominate artery) is an artery of the mediastinum that supplies blood to the right arm and the head and neck. It is the first branch of the aortic arch, and soon after it emerges, the brachiocephalic artery divides into the right common carotid artery and the right subclavian artery. There is no brachiocephalic artery for the left side of the body. The left common carotid, and the left subclavian artery, come directly off the aortic arch. However, there are two brachiocephalic veins.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Carotid_sinus	Carotid sinus	A07.231.114.186.456	In human anatomy, the carotid sinus is a localized dilation of the internal carotid artery at its origin, the common carotid artery.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Chordae_tendineae	Chordae tendineae	A07.541.510.240	The chordae tendineae (tendinous chords), or heart strings, are cord-like tendons that connect the papillary muscles to the tricuspid valve and the mitral valve in the heart. Chordae tendineae are approximately 80% collagen, while the remaining 20% is made up of elastin and endothelial cells.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Coronary_circulation	Coronary circulation	A07.231.114.269	"Coronary circulation is the circulation of blood in the blood vessels of the heart muscle. The vessels that deliver oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium are known as coronary arteries. The vessels that remove the deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. These include the great cardiac vein, the middle cardiac vein, the small cardiac vein and the anterior cardiac veins. As the left and right coronary arteries run on the surface of the heart, they can be called epicardial coronary arteries. These arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the heart muscle. These relatively narrow vessels are commonly affected by atherosclerosis and can become blocked, causing angina or a heart attack. The coronary arteries that run deep within the myocardium are referred to as subendocardial. The coronary arteries are classified as ""end circulation"", since they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium: there is very little redundant blood supply, which is why blockage of these vessels can be so critical."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corpora_quadrigemina	Corpora quadrigemina	A08.186.211.132.659.237	"In the brain, the corpora quadrigemina (Latin for ""quadruplet bodies"") are the four colliculiâ€”two inferior, two superiorâ€”located on the tectum of the dorsal aspect of the midbrain. They are respectively named the inferior and superior colliculus. The corpora quadrigemina are reflex centers involving vision and hearing."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Dural_venous_sinuses	Dural venous sinuses	A07.231.908.224	The dural venous sinuses (also called dural sinuses, cerebral sinuses, or cranial sinuses) are venous channels found between layers of dura mater in the brain. They receive blood from internal and external veins of the brain, receive cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space, and ultimately empty into the internal jugular vein.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Femoral_vein	Femoral vein	A07.231.908.314	In the human body, the femoral vein is a blood vessel that accompanies the femoral artery in the femoral sheath. It begins at the adductor canal (also known as Hunter's canal) and is a continuation of the popliteal vein. It ends at the inferior margin of the inguinal ligament, where it becomes the external iliac vein.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Hard_palate	Hard palate	A02.835.232.781.324.502.660	The hard palate is a thin horizontal bony plate of the skull, located in the roof of the mouth. It spans the arch formed by the upper teeth. It is formed by the palatine process of the maxilla and horizontal plate of palatine bone. It forms a partition between the nasal passages and the mouth. Also on the anterior portion of the roof of the hard palate is the Rugae which are the irregular ridges in the mucous membrane that help facilitate the movement of food backwards towards the pharynx. This partition is continued deeper into the mouth by a fleshy extension called the soft palate.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_heart	Human heart	A07.541	The human heart is an organ that provides a continuous blood circulation through the cardiac cycle and is one of the most vital organs in the human body. The heart is divided into four main chambers: the two upper chambers are called the left and right atria (singular atrium) and two lower chambers are called the right and left ventricles. There is a thick wall of muscle separating the right side and the left side of the heart called the septum. Normally with each beat the right ventricle pumps the same amount of blood into the lungs that the left ventricle pumps out into the body. Physicians commonly refer to the right atrium and right ventricle together as the right heart and to the left atrium and left ventricle as the left heart. The electric energy that stimulates the heart occurs in the sinoatrial node, which produces a definite potential and then discharges, sending an impulse across the atria. We don't know very well how the electric signal moves in the atria. It seems that in the atria the electrical signal moves in a radial way, but Bachmann's bundle and coronary sinus muscle play a role in conduction between the two atria which have a nearly simultaneous systole. While in the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the myocardium. The human embryonic heart begins beating at around 21 days after conception, or five weeks after the last normal menstrual period (LMP). The first day of the LMP is normally used to date the start of the gestation (pregnancy). The human heart begins beating at a rate near the motherâ€™s, about 75-80 beats per minute (BPM). The embryonic heart rate (EHR) then accelerates by approximately 100 BPM during the first month to peak at 165-185 BPM during the early 7th week after conception, (early 9th week after the LMP). This acceleration is approximately 3.3 BPM per day, or about 10 BPM every three days, which is an increase of 100 BPM in the first month. The regression formula, which describes this acceleration before the embryo reaches 25Â mm in crown-rump length, or 9.2 LMP weeks, is: the Age in days = EHR(0.3)+6. After 9.1 weeks after the LMP, it decelerates to about 152 BPM (Â±25 BPM) during the 15th week post LMP. After the 15th week, the deceleration slows to an average rate of about 145 (Â±25 BPM) BPM, at term. There is no difference in female and male heart rates before birth. The human heart and its disorders (cardiopathies) are studied primarily by cardiologists.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_sternum	Sternum	A02.835.232.904.766	"The sternum (from Greek ÏƒÏ„Î­ÏﾁÎ½Î¿Î½, sternon, ""chest""; plural ""sternums"" or ""sterna"") or breastbone is a long flat bony plate shaped like a capital ""T"" located anteriorly to the heart in the center of the thorax (chest). It connects to the rib bones via cartilage, forming the anterior section of the rib cage with them, and thus helps to protect the lungs, heart and major blood vessels from physical trauma. Although it is fused, the sternum can be sub-divided into three regions: the manubrium, the body, and the xiphoid process. The sternum is sometimes cut open to gain access to the thoracic contents when performing cardiothoracic surgery."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lunate_bone	"Lunate bone ""Cow chin Bone"""	A02.835.232.087.144.663	"The lunate bone (semilunar bone) is a carpal bone (wrist bone) in the human hand that may be distinguished by its deep concavity and crescentic outline. It is situated in the center of the proximal row of the carpus region between the fore arm and hand (manus). In standard medical posture, the lunate carpal bone is situated between the lateral Scaphoid bone and medial Triquetral bone. The lunate carpal bone straddles distally the bordering ulna and radius bones and proximally to distal carpus (wrist) Trapezium bone and Trapezoid bone. The etymology of the Lunate bone derives from the Latin luna which means ""moon"", the lunate bone looks semi-similar to a crescent moon. In amphibians and reptiles, the bone is instead referred to as the intermedium, because of its position between the other two proximal carpals."
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Nasal_concha	Nasal concha	A02.835.232.781.324.948	"In anatomy, a nasal concha (or turbinate) is a long, narrow and curled bone shelf (shaped like an elongated sea-shell) that protrudes into the breathing passage of the nose. Turbinate bone refers to any of the scrolled spongy bones of the nasal passages in vertebrates. In humans, the turbinates divide the nasal airway into four groove-like air passages, and are responsible for forcing inhaled air to flow in a steady, regular pattern around the largest possible surface of cilia and climate-controlling tissue. A rapidly dilating arteriolar circulation to these bones may lead to a sharp increase in the pressure within in response to acute cooling of the body core - the pain from this pressure is often referred to as ""brain freeze"", and is frequently associated with the rapid consumption of ice cream."

The rectouterine pouch is used in the treatment of end-stage renal failure in patients who are treated by peritoneal dialysis. The tip of the dialysis catheter is placed into the deepest point of the pouch. In women it is the deepest point of the peritoneal cavity, posterior to (behind) the uterus and anterior to (in front of) rectum. (The pouch on the other side of the uterus is the vesicouterine excavation. ) It is near the posterior fornix of the vagina. In men, the region corresponding to the rectouterine pouch is the rectovesical excavation, which lies between the urinary bladder and rectum. (There is no equivalent to the vesicouterine excavation.)
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Renal_artery	Renal artery	A07.231.114.745	The renal arteries normally arise off the side of the abdominal aorta, immediately below the superior mesenteric artery, and supply the kidneys with blood. Each is directed across the crus of the diaphragm, so as to form nearly a right angle with the aorta. The renal arteries carry a large portion of total blood flow to the kidneys. Up to a third of total cardiac output can pass through the renal arteries to be filtered by the kidneys. The arterial supply of the kidneys is variable and there may be one or more renal arteries supplying each kidney. It is located above the renal vein. Supernumerary renal arteries (two or more arteries to a single kidney) are the most common renovascular anomaly, occurrence ranging from 25% to 40% of kidneys. It has a radius of approximately 0.25Â cm, 0.26Â cm at the root. The measured mean diameter can differ depending on the imaging method used. For example, the diameter was found to be 5.04 Â± 0.74Â mm using ultrasound, but 5.68 Â± 1.19Â mm using angiography.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Spinal_nerve	Spinal nerve	A08.800.800.720	The term spinal nerve generally refers to a mixed spinal nerve, which carries motor, sensory, and autonomic signals between the spinal cord and the body. Humans have 31 left-right pairs of spinal nerves, each roughly corresponding to a segment of the vertebral column: 8 cervical spinal nerve pairs (C1-C8), 12 thoracic pairs (T1-T12), 5 lumbar pairs (L1-L5), 5 sacral pairs (S1-S5), and 1 coccygeal pair. The spinal nerves are part of the peripheral nervous system (PNS).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Subarachnoid_space	Subarachnoid space	A08.186.566.166.686	In the central nervous system, the subarachnoid cavity (subarachnoid space) is the interval between the arachnoid membrane and pia mater. It is occupied by spongy tissue consisting of trabeculae (delicate connective tissue filaments that extend from the arachnoid mater and blend into the pia mater) and intercommunicating channels in which the cerebrospinal fluid is contained. This cavity is small on the surface of the hemispheres of the brain. On the summit of each gyrus the pia mater and the arachnoid are in close contact, but in the sulci between the gyri, triangular spaces are left, in which the subarachnoid trabecular tissue is found. Whilst the pia mater closely follows the surface of the brain and dips into the sulci, the arachnoid bridges across them from gyrus to gyrus. At certain parts of the base of the brain, the arachnoid is separated from the pia mater by wide intervals, which communicate freely with each other and are named subarachnoid cisternÃ¦; in these the subarachnoid tissue is less abundant. The subarachnoid space is the location of the interface between the vascular tissue and the cerebrospinal fluid and is active in the blood brain barrier. The arachnoid mater continues down the spinal cord too, and the subarachnoid layer with it. It serves a similar function in the spinal cord as it does in the brain.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Superior_vena_cava	Superior vena cava	A07.231.908.949.815	The superior vena cava (also known as the cava or cva) is a large diameter, yet short, vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body to the heart's right atrium. It is located in the anterior right superior mediastinum. It is formed by the left and right brachiocephalic veins (also referred to as the innominate veins), which also receive blood from the upper limbs, eyes and neck, behind the lower border of the first right costal cartilage. The azygos vein joins it just before it enters the right atrium, at the upper right front portion of the heart. It is also known as the cranial vena cava in animals. No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium. As a result, the (right) atrial and (right) ventricular contractions are conducted up into the internal jugular vein and, through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, can be seen as the jugular venous pressure. In tricuspid valve regurgitation, these pulsations are very strong.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Vocal_pedagogy	The anatomy of the Vocal folds	A04.329.364.737	Vocal pedagogy is the study of the art and science of voice instruction. It is used in the teaching of singing and assists in defining what singing is, how singing works, and how proper singing technique is accomplished. Vocal pedagogy covers a broad range of aspects of singing, ranging from the physiological process of vocal production to the artistic aspects of interpretation of songs from different genres or historical eras. Typical areas of study include: Human anatomy and physiology as it relates to the physical process of singing. Breathing and air support for singing Posture for singing Phonation Vocal resonation or voice projection Diction, vowels and articulation Vocal registration Sostenuto and legato for singing Other singing elements, such as range extension, tone quality, vibrato, coloratura Vocal health and voice disorders related to singing Vocal styles, such as learning to sing opera, belt, or Art song Phonetics Voice classification All of these different concepts are a part of developing proper vocal technique. Not all vocal teachers have the same opinions within every topic of study which causes variations in pedagogical approaches and vocal technique.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Corneal_epithelium	Corneal epithelium	A09.371.060.217.325	The corneal epithelium (epithelium corneÃ¦ anterior layer) is made up of epithelial tissue and covers the front of the cornea. It acts as a barrier to protect the cornea, resisting the free flow of fluids from the tears, and prevents bacteria from entering the epithelium and corneal stroma. The corneal epithelium consists of several layers of cells. The cells of the deepest layer are columnar, known as basal cells. Then follow two or three layers of polyhedral cells, commonly known as wing cells. The majority of these are prickle cells, similar to those found in the stratum mucosum of the cuticle. Lastly, there are three or four layers of squamous cells, with flattened nuclei. The layers of the epithelium are constantly undergoing mitosis. Basal and wing cells migrate to the anterior of the cornea, while squamous cells age and slough off into the tear film.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Endolymphatic_sac	Endolymphatic sac	A09.246.631.909.957.360.701	From the posterior wall of the saccule a canal, the ductus endolymphaticus, is given off; this duct is joined by the ductus utriculosaccularis, and then passes along the aquaeductus vestibuli and ends in a blind pouch, the endolymphatic sac, on the posterior surface of the petrous portion of the temporal bone, where it is in contact with the dura mater. Studies suggest that the endolymphatic duct and endolymphatic sac perform both absorptive and secretory, as well as phagocytic and immunodefensive,functions. Neoplasms of the Endolymphatic sac are very rare tumors.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Horizontal_semicircular_canal	Horizontal semicircular canal	A09.246.631.663	The lateral or horizontal canal (external semicircular canal) is the shortest of the three canals. Movement of fluid within this canal corresponds to rotation of the head around a vertical axis (i.e. the neck).
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Inferior_ganglion_of_vagus_nerve	Inferior ganglion of vagus nerve	A08.340.390.550	The nodose ganglion (ganglion of the trunk; inferior ganglion of vagus nerve) is cylindrical in form, of a reddish color, and 2.5Â cm in length. It is located in the height of the transverse process of the first cervical vertebra (atlas). Passing through it is the cranial portion of the accessory nerve, which blends with the vagus below the ganglion. As opposed to the jugular ganglion of the vagus nerve, the inferior or nodose ganglion is larger. It is chiefly visceral afferent in function concerning sensation of heart, larynx, lungs and alimentary tract from the pharynx to the transverse colon. These visceral afferents synapse centrally in the nucleus solitarius. Both ganglia are traversed by parasympathetic, and perhaps some sympathetic fibres. Preganglionic motor fibres (ganglionic branches) from the dorsal vagal nucleus and the special visceral efferents from the nucleus ambiguus, which descend to the inferior vagal ganglion form a band skirting the ganglion.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Lateral_hypothalamus	Lateral hypothalamus	A08.186.211.730.385.357.300	The lateral hypothalamus or lateral hypothalamic area is a part of the hypothalamus. It is concerned with hunger. Damage to this area can cause reduced food intake. Stimulating the lateral hypothalamus causes a desire to eat, while stimulating the ventromedial hypothalamus causes a desire to stop eating.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Occipital_sinus	Occipital sinus	A07.231.908.224	The occipital sinus is the smallest of the cranial sinuses. It is situated in the attached margin of the falx cerebelli, and is generally single, but occasionally there are two. It commences around the margin of the foramen magnum by several small venous channels, one of which joins the terminal part of the transverse sinus; it communicates with the posterior internal vertebral venous plexuses and ends in the confluence of the sinuses. Occipital sinuses were discovered by Guichard Joseph Duverney.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Osseous_spiral_lamina	Osseous spiral lamina	A09.246.631.246.930	The osseous spiral lamina is a bony shelf or ledge which projects from the modiolus into the interior of the canal, and, like the canal, takes two-and-three-quarter turns around the modiolus. It reaches about half-way toward the outer wall of the tube, and partially divides its cavity into two passages or scalae, of which the upper is named the scala vestibuli, while the lower is termed the scala tympani. Near the summit of the cochlea the lamina ends in a hook-shaped process, the hamulus laminae spiralis; this assists in forming the boundary of a small opening, the helicotrema, through which the two scalae communicate with each other. From the spiral canal of the modiolus numerous canals pass outward through the osseous spiral lamina as far as its free edge. In the lower part of the first turn a second bony lamina, the secondary spiral lamina, projects inward from the outer wall of the bony tube; it does not, however, reach the primary osseous spiral lamina, so that if viewed from the vestibule a narrow fissure, the vestibule fissure, is seen between them.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Preorbital_gland	Preorbital gland	D007765	The preorbital gland is a paired exocrine gland found in many species of hoofed animals, which is homologous to the lacrimal gland found in humans. These glands are trenchlike slits of dark blue to black, nearly bare skin extending from the medial canthus of each eye. They are lined by a combination of sebaceous and sudoriferous glands, and they produce secretions which contain pheromones and other semiochemical compounds. Ungulates frequently deposit these secretions on twigs and grass as a means of communication with other animals. The preorbital gland serves different roles in different species. Pheromone-containing secretions from the preorbital gland may serve to establish an animal's dominance (especially in preparation for breeding), mark its territory, or simply to produce a pleasurable sensation to the animal. Because of its critical role in scent marking, the preorbital gland is usually considered as a type of scent gland. A further function of these glands may be to produce antimicrobial compounds against skin pathogens. Antimicrobial compounds found in these glands may be biosynthesized by the animal itself, or by microorganisms that live in these glands.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Rhombic_lips	Metencephalon	A08.186.211.132.810.428	Rhombic lips are a posterior section of the developing metencephalon within an embryo. They extend posteriorly from the roof of the fourth ventricle to dorsal neuroepithelial cells and contain cerebellar precursor cells, among others.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Saccular_Acoustic_Sensitivity	Saccule	A09.246.631.909.625	Saccular Acoustic Sensitivity is a measurement of the ear's affectability to sound. The saccule's normal function is to keep the body balanced, but it is believed to have some hearing function for special frequencies and tones. Saccular acoustic sensitivity is considered to be simply an extension of the sense of hearing through the use of the saccule.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Thoracic_nerves	Thoracic nerves	A08.800.800.720.800	The thoracic nerves are the spinal nerves emerging from the thoracic vertebrae. Branches also exit the spine and go directly to the Sympathetic Chain Ganglia of the Autonomic Nervous System where they are involved in the functions of organs and glands in the head, neck, thorax and abdomen.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Ventromedial_nucleus	Ventromedial nucleus	A08.186.211.730.385.357.352.953	"The ventromedial nucleus (sometimes referred to as the ventromedial hypothalamus or VMH) is a nucleus of the hypothalamus. ""The ventromedial hypothalamus (VMH) is a distinct morphological nucleus involved in feeding, fear, thermoregulation, and sexual activity."""
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Human_mouth	Mouth	A01.456.505.631	In human anatomy, the mouth is the first portion of the alimentary canal that receives food and saliva. The oral mucosa is the mucous membrane epithelium lining the inside of the mouth. In addition to its primary role as the beginning of the digestive system, in humans the mouth also plays a significant role in communication. While primary aspects of the voice are produced in the throat, the tongue, lips, and jaw are also needed to produce the range of sounds included in human language. The mouth, normally moist, is lined with a mucous membrane, and contains the teeth. The lips mark the transition from mucous membrane to skin, which covers most of the body.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Medial_collateral_ligament	Medial collateral ligament	A02.513.514.162.600	The medial collateral ligament (MCL or tibial collateral ligament) is one of the four major ligaments of the knee. It is on the medial (inner) side of the knee joint in humans and other primates.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Posterior_cruciate_ligament	Posterior cruciate ligament	A02.513.514.600	The posterior cruciate ligament (or PCL) is one of the four major ligaments of the knee. It connects the posterior intercondylar area of the tibia to the medial condyle of the femur. This configuration allows the PCL to resist forces pushing the tibia posteriorly relative to the femur. In the quadruped stifle (analogous to the human knee), based on its anatomical position, it is referred to as the caudal cruciate ligament. The PCL is an intracapsular ligament along with the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) because it lies deep within the knee joint. They are both isolated from the fluid-filled synovial cavity, with the synovial membrane wrapped around them. The PCL gets its name by attaching to the posterior portion of the tibia.
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Epineurial_repair	Cross Section of Epineurium	A08.800.800	Epineurial repair is a common surgical procedure to repair a nerve laceration via the epineurium, the connective tissue surrounding nerve fibers originating from the spinal cord. It is intended to allow the restoration of sensory function. When a nerve is lacerated or cut, repair is done by sewing the cut ends together through the epineurium to increase the potential proximal part growing correctly along the route the degrading distal part leaves behind. Usual sensation and mobility will not be an immediate result because nerves grow at a rate of approximately 1 millimeter per day so it will take a few months to notice the final outcome. Research in use of nerve grafts and nerve growth factors is being done to speed recovery time.

http://dbpedia.org/resource/Blood%E2%80%93air_barrier	Alveolarâ€“capillary barrier	A04.411.715.025	The alveolarâ€“capillary barrier (or membrane, or bloodâ€“air barrier) exists in the gas exchanging region of the lungs. It exists to prevent air bubbles from forming in the blood, and from blood entering the alveoli. It is formed by the type 1 pneumocytes of the alveolar wall, the endothelial cells of the capillaries and the basement membrane between the two cells. The barrier is permeable to molecular oxygen, carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and many other gases. This blood gas barrier is extremely thin (approximately 2Î¼m) (600â€“800Â nm; in some places merely 200Â nm) to allow sufficient oxygen diffusion, yet it is extremely strong. This strength comes from the type IV collagen in between the endothelial and epithelial cells. Damage can occur to this barrier at a pressure difference of around 40 millimetres of mercury . Failure of the barrier is often seen in racehorses and other domesticated horses due to exercise induced blood pressure rising above normal. Failure of the barrier may occur in a pulmonary barotrauma. This can be a result of several possible causes, including blast injury, and breathing gas entrapment or retention in the lung during depressurization, which can occur during ascent from underwater diving or loss of pressure from a pressurized vehicle, habitat or pressure suit. A possible consequence of rupture of the bloodâ€“air barrier is arterial gas embolism
http://dbpedia.org/resource/Reticular_membrane	Reticular membrane	A09.246.631.246.292.906	The reticular membrane (RM, also called reticular lamina or apical cuticular plate) is a thin, stiff lamina that extends from the outer hair cells to the Hensen's cells. The RM is composed of the phalangeal extensions of the outer hair cells interspaced with extensions coming from the outer phalangeal cells. The RM separates endolymph in the cochlear duct from underlying corticolymph and perilymph of the scala tympani. The hair processes of the outer hair cells emerge through and above the RM, thus immobilizing the apical pole of the outer hair cells. At the opposite basilar pole, the outer hair cells are firmly held by the phalangeal cells. The inner phalangeal cells that surround the inner hair cells reach the surface of the organ of corti, but, even their inner-most row, are not included in the reticular membrane. Thus, the RM up to the outer edge of the tectorial membrane and does not extend unto the surface of the organ of corti.
