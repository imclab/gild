Extensions of Brainomics Cubicweb cube that are shared by several projects


On some computers, there are some conflicts between bootstrap (0.6.0) and brainomics (0.4.6).
You can use the older bootstrap version 0.4.1 by:

```
# sudo apt-get install cubicweb-bootstrap
```

It could solve the errors.
